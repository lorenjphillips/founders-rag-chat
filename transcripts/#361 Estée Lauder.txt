I'm reading this book called Money Masters of Our Time written by John Train and there's a chapter on Warren Buffett in here and in the chapter on Warren Buffett there's an incredible quote from Warren Buffett where he says that a good manager must be a demon on cost. Buffett knows what most of history's greatest founders knew with that watching your cost was the foundation on which other competitive advantages can be built listen to what Jeff Bezos wrote about this in his shareholder letters Jeff wrote. Focus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford lower prices which drives growth growth spreads fixed costs across more sales reducing cost per unit which makes possible more price reductions customers like this and it's good for shareholders please expect us to repeat this loop. Bezos brings up the importance of controlling your spending watching your costs again in another shareholder letter he says we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture. What other trade to history's greatest founders have in common they all studied the great founders that came before them Jeff Bezos is on record over and over again talking about the influence that Sam Walton had on hit the way he built Amazon. Sam Walton said in his autobiography you can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you're too inefficient the way to think about this is that most success comes to efficiency and most failures are due to waste here we go back to Buffett. The really good manager doesn't wake up in the morning and say this is the day that I'm going to cut costs any more than he wakes up and decides to practice breathing you keep costs low from the start if you read that a company is instigating a cost cutting program then you know that management has been slacking.

Lauder she's one of my favorite entrepreneurs is the third time I have read her autobiography. Business is not something to be tried on it's not a distraction not an affair not a momentary fling business marries you you sleep with it eat with it think about it much of your time it is in a very real sense an act of love if it isn't an act of love it's merely work not business what makes a successful entrepreneur is a talent well perhaps although I've known many enormously successful people who are not gifted in any outstanding way. Not blessed with particular talent is it then intelligence certainly intelligence helps but it's not necessarily the education or the kind of intellectual reasoning needed to graduate from the Wharton School of Business that are essential how many of your grandfathers came here from the old country and made a mark in America without the language money or contacts what then is the mystical ingredient it's persistent it's that certain little spirit that compels you to stick it out just when you're at your most important position. You're most tired it's that quality that forces you to persevere find the route around the stonewall it's the immovable stubbornness that will not allow you to cave in when everyone says give up just before we decided to commit ourselves to cosmetics full time our accountant and lawyer took us out to dinner. That's something grave to tell us don't do it that was the advice the mortality rate in the cosmetics industry is high and you'll rule the day that you invested your savings and your time into this impossible business we beg of you don't do it we did it we make the business decisions no one else we make them. Mark Twain once said keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but they're really great make you feel that you too can become great our first year sales amounted to about $50,000 expenses ate up just about every dime no matter forward. That is an excerpt from the book that I just finished reading for the third time one of my all time favorite entrepreneur autobiographies definitely on my route Mount Rushmore book keeps getting better every time I read it and is the autobiography of s day a lotter the book is called s day a success story and it was published almost 40 years ago and keep in mind as we go through this today she was 77 when she is writing these words and still working every day still going strong. The way I think about her is I really think she's just an American badass I say it's over and over again I really think a lot of today's entrepreneurs should try to emulate s day and if she was alive that she be kicking other entrepreneurs ass up and down the court. Warren Buffett Charlie monger said it should be a crime that more business schools are not studying Henry Singleton that's the way I feel I think it's a crime that more entrepreneurs don't study as they lauders I'm gonna jump right into it. It starts with a very painful memory at the very beginning of her career okay so she just said the end of the first year of her company they did $50,000 of revenue think last year they did something like 16 billion companies almost 80 years old and what's remarkable is that. Her empire starts as just a small concession stand at a single counter inside of a single beauty salon and when it starts she is the sole employee and so there's something that happens at this beauty salon that stayed now she's talking about this you know 40 years after it happened maybe even longer. And yet she can remember it like it was yesterday she says I remember the woman at the Florence Morris beauty salon where I had my first cosmetic concession she was thoughtless and cruel and will always remain that way in my mind. Maybe she was a catalyst for good in the end maybe I wouldn't have become a stay lauder if it hadn't been for her at the moment she was cast in my memory to last there forever I despised her. Simply thinking about that incident brings back pain she was having her hair combed and she was lovely I was very young and vulnerable and I loved beauty I felt I wanted to make contact with her in some small way. What a beautiful blouse you're wearing I said to her it's so elegant do you mind if I ask you where you bought it she smiled what difference could it possibly make you could never afford it. I walked away heart pounding face burning is the punch line is entire section this is why I'm reading this to you never never never will anyone say that to me again I promise myself someday I will have whatever I want. And then one of the most interesting things is she then starts her autobiography that that's the first story right but then she doesn't go into her early life she's not talking about herself. She's talking about her obsession her obsession with beauty and there's a multiple things that are going on in this next few pages I think are important I'll just tell you. A few of them number one beauty is an ancient industry which leads to number two which allows her to build a business around things that will never change. And so Jeff Bezos famously said in the early days Amazon he thought it was really important to build your business around things that won't change so at the very beginning. You realize a people always gonna want low prices they're gonna want faster delivery and they're gonna want wide selection they're gonna want that today they're gonna want that ten years from now they're gonna want that twenty years for now so that means he can invest heavily in those areas and reap the benefits for many decades to come. Which leads to the third thing that's obvious by say lauter she studied the history of her industry and then the fourth thing it's not even implied she says that over and over again she's completely obsessed she loved beauty this was not. Beauty was a mission for her it was not just a product and so she says beauty has always commanded attention beauty secrets have been passed on from mother to daughter through the ages so she talks about what primitive women were doing thousands of years ago she talks about what they were doing in Rome what Cleopatra was doing what they were doing Egypt. And she says women have always enhanced their God given looks it has always been so it will always be so and then she speaks to why this is her mission and why she made this her life's work what it does for her customers beauty is the best incentive to self respect you may have a great in a resource but they don't show up as confidence when you don't feel pretty people are more apt to believe you and like you when you look fine and when the world approves self respect is just a little easier. The pursuit of beauty is honorable and then she continues talking about her obsession but really this is a universal appeal of the product in the industry that she built her empire in beauty transcends class intellects age profession geography virtually every culture and economic barrier there isn't a culture in the world that hasn't powdered perfumed and prettied its women love has been planted wars one and empires built on beauty I should know I'm an authority on all three love war. Wars and empires have been woven into my personal tapestry for decades I've been selling beauty ever since I could recognize her and the last line is very important because that is one of the most important traces she has she is a master world class salesperson she talks about it over and over again in fact she says I have never worked a day in my life without selling if I believe in something I sell it and I sell it hard. And then the most important relationship that she's going to have outside of the one she obviously has with her immediate family with her husband and her kids is the one with her mother true interest tends to be revealed early and we definitely see that's the case with as a lauter and beauty she says the first beauty ever recognized was my mother. As they would observe the way her mother emphasized her own beauty routine my mother began brushing her golden hair in the morning even before she opened her eyes I remember her reaching out for that brush as soon as she began to stir I adored my mother's hair brush her hand cream and the gloves when she passed away at eighty eight years old she was still beautiful what I love that as days mother did she instilled self confidence and self belief into her daughter really really early it's obvious if you read as days autobiography she does not lack for confidence. Our self belief you're as beautiful as you think you are she would tell me the secret is to imagine yourself the most important person in that room the person everyone else is waiting to see if you imagine it vividly enough you will become that person. And if you could see the notes I left myself throughout the book a lot of them are just ever Pete over and over again the fact that she was born for this business that she was in that it's really important to pick a career that you have an immense passion about in fact I love what Charlie advice that Charlie Munger gave. Where he said in my whole life I've never been good at something I wasn't very interested in it just doesn't work there's no substitute for strong interest he could be speaking about and describing as they lauder my very first memories that of my mother sent her or a freshness the perfume of her presence. My first sensation of joy was being allowed to reach up and touch her fragrant and satiny skin her hair didn't escape my attention either as soon as I was old enough to hold a brush I'd give her no peace as they you've already brushed my hair three times today I can still hear her complaining. My older sister Renee submitted to getting her face padded with my mother's cream my sister-in-law was perpetually saint like in her submission to my treatments all of this annoyed my father considerably stop fiddling with other people's faces he'd say. But that is what I like to do listen to this paragraph it's insane but that is what I like to do touch other people's faces no matter who they were touch them and make them pretty before I'm finished all set I'm certain the world's record. For face touching I could spin magic on the faces of my family as soon as school was over I'd run home and start on faces and hair even at eight years old even then I knew. This continues this is what she says about her childhood obsession a few years later I want to paint a picture of the young girl I was a girl caught up mesmerized by pretty things and pretty people thinking about my childhood now reveal such early patterns my drive and persistence were always there. And those are qualities that are central for building a successful business still I sometimes wonder if I had set my heart on selling anything else but beauty would have risen to the top of my profession somehow I doubt it I believed in my product I love my product a person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it too. And beauty was such a bountiful harvest how could I have known this at twelve years old I don't understand it I just did. And so estate lauter has a lot of the same traits that are covered in one of my favorite talks on YouTube which is called running down a dream how to succeed and thrive in a career you love. By bill girly and is a line in in that talk that also speaks to what the advice of Charlie monger just gave us that you know there's really no substitute for having this deep. In green like really strong interest in what you're doing and the line for running down a dream that I think applies to a lot of a lot of the great entrepreneurs that you and I speak about. Is that someone else has a deep passion for whatever career path you're on and they're going to smoke you if you don't have it yourself. And I think that's tied to another one of my favorite maxims which comes from earn a shackleton by endurance we conquer we have in this book thing about it she's seventy seven years old she's writing the book she's talking about an obsession that has taken hold of her. Almost seventy years ago and never let her go if you love it you're going to do it all the time if you do it all the time you're going to get really good at it and more importantly you won't quit by endurance we conquer. All the successes so many decades into the future as they lauter the company is I think seventy eight years old as of today they did fifty thousand dollars of revenue their first year they did sixteen billion last year. And so keep that in mind she's about to talk about one of the most important experiences she has she starts working at a very young age with her uncle so she says when I dreamed of my private universe I dreamed of being a skin specialist and making women beautiful. Since I had heard that many of my mother's family did just that my shining moment came in the form of a quiet man who also loved touching faces my uncle John my mother's brother came to visit us from Hungary he was a skin specialist what glories those words conjured up. He captured my imagination and interest as no one else ever had. I was smitten with uncle John he understood me what's more he produced miracles the first beauty products that as they lauders ever going to sell are the ones that her uncle John makes. I recognize in my uncle John my true path he produced his glorious cream in our home working happily over a gas stove. I watched I learned I was hypnotized my education was just starting I was devoted to it I loved his creams loved his potions loved my uncle John this is the story of bewitchment I was bewitched by the power to create beauty. Uncle John had worlds to teach me we constructed a laboratory of sorts in the tiny stable behind the house do you know what it means for a young girl to suddenly have someone take her dreams quite seriously to teach her secrets I could think of nothing else. After school I'd run home to practice being a scientist I began to value myself so much more to trust my instincts to trust my uniqueness trustings oneself does not always come naturally. If learned when young the practice sticks today there was no one who can intimidate me because of title or skill or fame I do what's right for me. And this is a preview of what her business is going to be like because everywhere she goes she carries her products with her and she'll strike up conversation and she'll do like these mini makeovers and convert customers one at a time she was doing this back in high school I didn't have a single friend who wasn't slathered in our creams. Deep inside I knew I had found something that mattered much more than popularity my moment had come and I was not about to miss easing it uncle John loved me I loved him and my future was being written in a jar of cream. Okay so now here's something that's gonna be surprising so she's you know eight years old twelve years old sixteen years old she's completely obsessed she's essentially gonna do this business for free for fun for a few decades. In the family she was raised in at the time that she's living it is expected to go from her family's house to her husband's house she gets married young she's around twenty two years old they have their first kid I think two three years later so she's twenty four twenty five years old she's a housewife. And this entire time she doesn't found as they lauder companies so she's thirty eight this is you know a decade and a half in the future and during this entire time she's still running a business it's just for fun. And this is a great description of her obsession we were struggling so hard to be independent and sometimes this was not easy times were lean we had a beautiful son and I spent my days mothering. And all the time all the time I was mothering my zeal for experimenting with my uncle's creams improving on them adding to them I was forever experimenting on myself and on anyone else who came within range. Good was not good enough I could always make it better I now know that obsession is the word for my zeal it was never quiet in the house there was always a great audible sense of industry especially in the kitchen. Where I cooked for my family and during every possible spare moment cooked up a little pots of cream for faces I always felt most alive when I was dabbling in the practice cream I felt as though I was conducting a secret absorbing experiment a real adventure. And I think the zeal that she has for beauty for developing our products for teaching beauty a lot of what she does is teaching how to use the products what they can do for you she did this for fun and that is going to directly lead to this foundation or see the founding of this. Empire which starts with just a single. Counter inside of a beauty salon so she'd go to this beauty salon once a month to get her hair dyed and and done and she is an extrovert in a master saleswoman and so she's talking to every single person in the salon she become friends with them invite them over to her house and then give them like free makeovers. So as many of the young women who came to Florence Morris that's the name of the beauty salon to get their hair done would come to my home for a quick beauty lesson I love sharing what I knew in creating excitement about skin one day. Mrs Morris the owner of the shop said to me what do you do to keep your skins looking so fresh and lovely it would turn out to be a question of great importance for me I didn't have to be asked twice the next time I come I said I'll bring you some of my products my heart was pounding. As they comes back a few weeks later for her normal appointment meets with Florence Morris again she says would you mind leaving them with me she asked as I offered my four products I'm so busy now I'll try them when I have time I knew better goes back to this master salesmanship is understanding of persuasion that as they had she said I knew better just let me show you how they work Mrs Morris give me five minutes and you'll see the right way to use them nothing could have induced me to leave my bounty without a demonstration I have to pause there before I go on that is one of the most important insights into the history of advertising so I've gone back and read you know countless biographies. About many of the great advertising agency founders many of them were founding their companies in the forties the fifties and sixties but they will tell you a lot of their ideas came from the early nineteen hundreds. And this one guy named Claude Hopkins Claude Hopkins may be the best copywriter of all time and the most influential thinker in the advertising industry he wrote this book called scientific advertising his boss Albert Lasker thought the book was so valuable that he locked it in a safe for twenty years because he didn't want his competitors to have access to the ideas eventually the book gets out of the safe gets printed and goes on to sell like eight or nine million copies. The reason I tell you all this is because there's a line in Claude Hopkins autobiography that is demonstrating exactly what Estee Lauder knew at this time in her life no argument in the world can ever compare with one dramatic demonstration. Estee knew that instinctively because she says nothing could have induced me to leave my bounty without a demonstration so she goes through this quick beauty routine and it says I showed Mrs. Morris a mirror she was raving beauty she then said do you think you would be interested in running the beauty concession. At my new salon I did not hesitate for a second up until that point I had been giving away my products this was my first chance at a real business I would have a small counter in her store I would pay her rent but whatever I sold would be mine to keep no partners I never did have partners I would risk the rent but if it worked I would start the business I always dreamed about risk taking this is one of my favorite sentences in the entire book risk taking is the cornerstone of everything. No one ever became a success without taking chances and this is one of the most remarkable things about Estee Lauder and why I you know I'm trying to like shout from the rooftops please study her like read her biography listen to the episodes I've done on her over and over again. She understood this by instinct this fundamental understanding of humans human nature and then combining that with building her business on a handful of simple principles. One of the most important things she will ever do again if you're going to want to go from $50,000 of sales in your first year to you know multiple you know 16 billion 70 years later customer loyalty over everything else customer loyalty over everything else she just understood this and so she invents at least she claims to and I haven't found any examples of other people doing this. She she claims to invent the sales technique of the century which is giving gifts with purchase and in sometimes giving gifts even without a purchase this is so powerful now the big secret I would give a woman a sample of whatever she did not buy as a gift it might be a few teaspoons of powder in a wax envelope. Perhaps I'd shave off a bit of lipstick and tell her to apply with her fingers perhaps in another envelope I would give her a bit of glow the point was this a woman would never leave empty handed a woman would never leave empty handed I did not have an advertising department I did not have a copywriter but I had intuition I just knew even though I had not yet named the technique that gift with a purchase was very appealing in those days I would even give a gift without a purchase the idea was to give a gift without a purchase. The idea was to convince a woman to try a product having tried it at her leisure in her own home and seeing how fresh and lovely made her look she would be faithful forever we're going to come back to this idea about customer loyalty and what and how I say lauter cultivated this over and over again she would be faithful forever of that I had not a single doubt again this is not just a similar I can come. This idea of the importance of customer loyalty over everything I feel has been like in a bunch of the books you know over the years but especially in the last few weeks the last few months go back to less swap one of Charlie mungers favorite founders he had this idea. He's like hey he ran these ads like we will change we will fill your tire and change your flat for free even if you don't buy anything and what he knew was that hey you come in we fix it for free we did you a service we did you a favor when it's time to get new tires you're going to go. Back regardless of price or anything else you are going to go back to the store that did something for you last week we had an example of this with fastenal they would custom order a part that they don't carry as a special request for a customer in that episode I referenced that Bugatti was doing this back in what the 1940s probably there's a line from Bugatti's biography he receives a letter 30 years he had sold this customer a car 30 years earlier something bad happened. They broke on it they don't have that part anymore Bugatti offered to custom manufacture that part and give it to him at cost a few weeks before that we talked about Sam Walton in the early days of Walmart if somebody would return something not only would he give them their money back he would instruct his sales people the one doing that return to give them a gift for free. Customer loyalty over everything a few pages later this should not be a surprise a devoted clientele was developing not to my surprise of course my products were the finest and the beauty salon atmosphere was perfect women were already in the self improvement mood think about this go to where your customers are that is what she's doing. The beauty salon atmosphere was perfect why should they go home with beautifully with beautiful hair and a tired lifeless face it made sense to sell a total beauty package word spread business move gradually but steadily I worked every day from nine. Her son is in school at this point so this is where we're just going to be a word spread business move gradually but steadily I moved I worked every day from nine a.m. when I arrived to polish my jars jars to six in the evening I never took lunch I felt I had to be there. For every woman or I would surely lose her I cleansed creamed colored talked talked talked and talked it worked like a charm and the interest in my products grew there is a line that Warren Buffett has when he describes Rose Blunken affectionately known as Mrs. B. and he says I would rather wrestle grizzlies than compete with her this would be an example of why the same would apply to a st. Lauder she's on vacation she's at a beautiful hotel poolside what do you think she's doing she walks over to the women at the poolside and she starts giving them free makeovers the response was electric. The next few years I spent some weeks alone at this hotel or that hotel as what what might be called working vacations many women would gather around and ask me to teach them about skin care and cosmetics it was fun for them and profitable for me. Women wanted to learn one summer after another I pushed myself lot in creams making up women selling beauty in the winners I visit these eager ladies at their homes. Where with a bridge game as a backdrop I'd make up their friends and sell more creams the mood of these sessions was as exhilarating for me as for them I didn't need bread to eat but I worked as though I did for the pure love of the venture for me teaching about beauty was and is an emotional experience I brought them charisma and knowledge about their possibilities they gave me a sense of success I felt flushed with excitement after each session. That is the positive side obsession what is the negative side it's going to destroy her marriage. Now I should speak of a time of great pain and great confusion it's difficult for me to speak of it I'm always reluctant to divulge intimate family matters but I've determined to be candid in this book so I shell I'm a visceral person by nature I act on instinct quickly without pondering possible disaster and without indulging in deep introspection. This quality can work well in business where instinct counts and where one must be able to risk and take immediate action but same quality can be an irritant in personal relationships I was moving steadily forward and all the progress brought with it a great deal out of activity that neither interested nor in many ways included Joe Joe is her husband this is going to lead to divorce. Says when he wanted to talk I'd usually be off in another world thinking projecting planning my thoughts on a dozen projects my mind a world a world I was busy building a business I was single minded in the pursuit of my dream. Business itself was the purest romance for me so they're going to get divorced in nineteen thirty nine she considers this her greatest mistake she went to fixing her mistake they're going to. Get remarried and they're going to be married for over fifty years and there's an insight that she has here that I think also Sam Walton realize as well that I want to tell you about one second but she says we were never to be separated for longer than a few days ever again we always till the day he died. That day was the blackest saddest day of my life had each other to hold and to talk to. So Joe and I were remarried this time forever but with a few changes now this idea in this point is really important she makes it a family business for these obsessed obsessive entrepreneur types like a Sam Walton like an estate lauter like my friend Justin who I was just talking to this about. You want to spend so much of your time same way you want to spend so much of your time building your business one way to not have it absolutely destroy your personal life is to involve your family in that business. And so estate lauter convinces Joe to give up his business was wasn't doing as well and come help her with the estate lauter business and so I was tell my friend Justin about this because he's doing the same thing his wife is going to come into his business so they can dedicate a lot of time to the success of the business but also spend time together. And so when this book is published right this book is published in 1985 it is still considered a family business it doesn't go public I think like another 10 years after the fact so. Estate is obviously leading the company her husband helps her her son is involved Leonard the older son is involved at a very young age and then they have a second son like 10 years later and he works in the family business as well. Now I do not want to give you the mistaken perception that her business is just growing by leaps and bounds it is a slow steady crawl says nothing happened fast. You talk about you know that's this myth of the overnight success and since the session says it does not happen that way I cried more than I ate there was constant work constant attention to detail lost hours of sleep worries and heartaches friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging us. Despite all the naysayers there was never a single moment when I considered giving up that was simply not a viable alternative I had a secret weapon this is very fascinating keep in mind we're in 19. We might be 1940s at this point I had a secret weapon there were in those days before television and high gloss advertising only two key ways to communicate a message quickly. The telephone and the telegraph I came up with a third and it was potent tell a woman women were telling women so word of mouth was her base. That was her initial distribution women were telling women they were selling my cream before they even got to my salon tell a woman was the word of mouth campaign that launched Estee Lauder cosmetics and it's something she's going to use over and over again as we'll see. And she makes another point in addition to this there's just no way she's going to quit but she says I knew there was a business in beauty as long as there was a woman alive every day I touched 50 faces. So I think by now you've heard her say a few times that she was obsessed with beauty and obsessed with details and this is a combination of the two when she's deciding what the packaging what the jars of her cream will look like and so this is how she makes the decision. First of all I reasoned where would my jars sit in every woman's bathroom naturally second I knew that I wanted every woman to remember whose cream it was that was making her look so fresh and lovely the name would have to be embedded right on the jar. Needless to say the jar had to be beautiful and this is the hard part it couldn't clash with my customers bathroom decor. Having obtained sample jars my research consisted of matching the few colors to which I had narrowed my choices to wallpapers in every guest bathroom I could manage to visit every time I went to a friend's house or an elegant restaurant I would excuse myself from the company visit the bathroom and match my jar colors against a vast array of colors. There were silver bathrooms purple bathrooms black and white bathrooms brown bathrooms gold bathrooms pink bathrooms even red bathrooms which color would look wonderful in any bathroom I deliberated for weeks I spent an inordinate amount of time freshening up people must have been worried about my long absences. And so eventually she has her eyes set on growing out of beauty salons and into sacks 5th Avenue and she says that she needed a larger marketplace the great department stores because of the new phenomenon of charge accounts at the beauty salon her customers would have to pay for the merchandise. Accounts at the beauty salon her customers would have to pay for the merchandise with cash and some of the women that didn't have enough cash on them at the time would ask her well do you have a counter at sacks 5th Avenue and I could just add it to my charge account and so what she's about to do here she's going to repeat later stages as she's building her business but she wants to break into these stores through the ground up. And you also see why earlier she thought that persistence was the most important trait for an entrepreneur to have says my name was not exactly unknown at sacks 5th Avenue the tell a woman campaign had already resulted in hundreds of phone calls from women asking for my products the store was beginning to wonder about me the enthusiastic phone calls from my own clients were having effect she goes and talks to the cosmetic buyer this guy named Mr Robert Fisk. And he says no much time since he finally acceded to my millionth request. He gave me a small order for approximately $800 worth of merchandise hallelujah we decided to send my own customers and all the people with charge accounts at sacks a small elegant white printed card with gold lettering that read sacks 5th Avenue is proud to present the Estee Lauder line of cosmetics now available at our cosmetic department. And this is another example of that big things start small do we have a hundred wonderful products know we had for but she had a lot of confidence in those for products and you had to because this is where she goes and she's going to invest all of her savings previously she been making all of her products at home. And so they wind up getting their first like laboratory slash office it was a former restaurant they had to pay six months rent in advance we swallowed hard and signed the lease on the restaurants gas burners we cooked our creams we did everything ourselves every bit of work was done by hand. Forehands to be exact joes and mine we stayed up all night for nights on end snatching sleep in fits and starts and then she talks about the fact that breaking this mammoth barrier into retail for the first time was one of the most exciting moments that she'd ever known. And so by building up all this goodwill over years and years and years of developing her customer base literally one at a time. Then also doing this direct outreach campaign to her her customers but also sacks is customers that she just described here's the result all the people to whom I'd given samples all the people who had been telling other people all those people appeared on opening day at sacks 5th Avenue in two days we sold out. The fun was about to start and with that came the endless work the endless traveling the endless streams rivers tides torrents oceans of words I would utter in praise of the products I knew with a cream of the crop I was a woman with a mission I had to show as many women as I could reach not only how to be beautiful but how to stay beautiful. On the way I hoped in my secret heart to find fame and fortune it was 1946 that is the official founding of the Estee Lauder company she's around 38 years old at the time. And now she's often running because when she's in one sack store she's going to expand to other sack stores if she's in a bunch of sack stores that makes it easier to to expand into other department stores. And she just has a lot of great I really feel like great advice and great lessons for future generations of entrepreneurs this one this one stories about the importance of never underestimating a customer's desire it was a hundred and one in the shade in downtown San Antonio Texas and I was making my first personal appearance at the Estee Lauder counter in an elegant department store this is something she would do she would travel all over the country and launch she'd spend like a week or two there launch every single store personally to make sure that all the people are trained right and they were doing things to up to her expectations slowly a woman made her way towards us she was short swarthy and definitely out of her element she had no shoes and two gold teeth. She stopped directly in front of the counter then she pointed to one jar and looked up expectantly I was about to assist her when the salesperson tapped me on the shoulder not her Mrs Lauder don't waste your time she's not going to buy anything I know her type. I world around since when do you know how much money she has in her pocketbook I asked I went to work first the cleansing oil which I padded on and immediately took off then the cream pack then the super rich all purpose cream I worked all of it in and then remove the excess and then handed her a mirror she stared and stared and then smiled. She couldn't speak English I couldn't speak Spanish still at that moment I felt such a bond with that woman and she and I both marveled at the miracle of makeup. You know the ending to this story before I write it she bought two of everything I used on her face and the next day her relatives did the same I never forgot her she symbolized so much for me never be patronizing never underestimate any woman's desire for beauty. That proud woman embodies my entire philosophy. How bad do you want it I would open each store myself I might have to travel by bus train or donkey but I'd be there for a week to train the salespeople to set out the merchandise and to create the aura. And then that was another description of this free sales this free sample sales technique that she pioneered the free makeover she just gave that woman with no shoes and gold teeth. The free gift she would give with purchase the free gift sometimes without purchase and what this this is the engine that drove her business the reason to appear my counter was the gift to the customer the free something that would sell everything else it sounds so simple doesn't it. I'd have to agree it was simple most good ideas start in simplicity so much so that everyone wonders why no one did it before the sample was the most honest way to do business you give people a product to try. If they like it they buy it they haven't been lured by an advertisement but convinced by the product itself this is so smart what she did here and again this is instinct she just knew this to be true we took the money we had planned to use on advertising and invested instead in enough material to give away large quantities of our products. It was so simple that our competitors sneered when they heard what we were doing today even the banks are copying us. And so it's obvious as you go through the her life story that especially this point in her life she's acting with this insane sense of urgency and so she said that the fact that she started business when she was older she thought that was a distinct advantage. And I love the way she describes this I started late I didn't have the time for waiting. Women of a certain age or season enough to bypass certain temptations they can focus on their interest more steadily than their useful counterparts it takes a certain tunnel vision the ability to look directly ahead and older women are not quite as easily distracted they are usually more successful when they have an advantage of years. And then as a lotters just relentlessly resourceful how many people are willing to put in this type of effort she's going to recruit customers one by one and I would make the argument after this is she's actually not recruiting customers one by one on explain what I mean. In the early days of spending endless amount of time riding the rail so she's traveling all over the country on by train the sound of train wheels became background music to my dreams as I traveled around the country to be president each Estee Lauder counter opening I met the women. Who would one day be my customers at least I hope they would be to that and I never stop talking to people not ever if she sees a woman sitting by herself she'd go up they had love to make up your face and show your cream on make you so lovely to touch. She would give them a makeover for free and then she'd hand them a mirror she looked herself she couldn't believe it I gave her a little everything to take home she still writes to me. Now keep in mind by the time she's writing the book she's had she's been running a business for 40 years to this day I still receive mail from women I met all over the world met touched and made up during spontaneous moments and so my point is like well first how many people are willing to put in this type of effort. Recruiting customers one by one but think about that some of these people she might have met 20 years ago 30 years ago. They're still writing to her there's still customers of hers how many other customers have they gone and evangelized and recruited for Estee Lauder it wasn't a one-on-one if you're in things for the long term it's not a one-on-one interaction. It's one on 1000 because it's that person and then whoever that person tells and then whoever that person that that person tells tells and that just compounds and grows throughout the decades. And so the relentless resourcefulness doesn't stop there so you're you know you're launching your Estee Lauder you're inside of a department store right you're at the cosmetics counter do you think she stops at the cosmetics counter no she did not she goes to the when she's launching a store she'll go to every other department say they're selling dresses or hats what are the cases she'll make friends with the people she'll give them free samples and say hey when you sell that hat mention a new shade of lipstick might look good with the hat. I can make friends with saleswomen selling hats and she might suggest her customer that a free makeup at the Estee Lauder counter would enhance the new hat and measurably and the dress salesperson might mention to her customer that Estee Lauder has the perfect shade of lipstick to wear with the new dress. I would induce the whole store to speak for my products more relentless resourcefulness from her the point was to keep thinking to keep placing the products in the public eye to keep devising new ways of capturing the consumers attention. During the week i usually spent an opening promotion i made my business never to leave town without seeing every beauty editor of every magazine newspaper i brought them samples made up their faces gave them beauty advice i promoted beauty and made friends there is no such thing as bad time she's doing this. You know in a they were taller during like economic downturns that she's gonna be in trouble this response there's no such thing as bad times i kept telling myself there is no such thing as bad business business is there if you go after it. A few pages later more relentless resourceful behavior give full effort always everywhere no community was too small for my attention my absolutely full effort i had written for instance on a bus for 6 hours to open a small store in corpus christi texas the stores clientele was modest in size and economics no matter. Never underestimate people who live in small towns are those limited budgets people no matter where they live or on what their finances will spend if they're convinced of worth. This idea she repeats constantly go out build relationships make friends keep these friends for your entire career this is what i told you sam zell and charlie monger both said to me in different ways in person i used every second to make friends and to spread word about our products this is just fantastic advice she says never underestimate the value of an ally. And so one of early allies was this woman in helen blake and again never underestimate the value of an ally is a great line and she's on the phone with helen blake and the switches you know. She would say to me quite casually during a phone call i think you might want to give miss pope the merchandise manager from woodward a call i was with her yesterday and she mentioned that i look wonderful and i told her was due to your cosmetics and why just think. She'd like to know more about you that instant i would call miss pope if you do not do important things when you think of them you probably never will and you will lose out. Today they call this networking the sharing between colleagues it is one of the most powerful tools in business another great line about this imagine a business world where you are the seller and the buyers are your allies then go make that happen. Another thing that i say lauder does is really smart is she she wants to answer this question how can i get more women to buy their own perfume and her answer this question is genius is going to wind up launching this giant business line for them and so. I stay lauter had studied cocoa Chanel she quotes cocoa Chanel multiple times in this book at the point she's writing this book cocoa Chanel's. Perfume Chanel number five is widely popular but as they realize like perfume is very high margin very expensive product but at this time women don't buy it for themselves it's like. A man buys it for a woman to mark a special occasion like a birthday anniversary things like that and so she asked the question okay well how can i get American women to buy their own perfume how can i get the American women to buy your own perfume i would not call it perfume. I would call it youth do a bath oil that doubles as a skin perfume that would be acceptable for them to buy because a woman would buy her own bath oil right they're all taking baths a woman could buy herself a bottle of bath oil the same way that she buy lipstick without feeling guilty without waiting for her birthday or anniversary. And the result is something she has was a mini revolution this is why instead of using their French perfumes by the drop behind each year women were using you do by the bottle in their bath water it doesn't take a graduate school business to figure out that meant sales beautiful sales in 1953 you do you do did about. Fifty thousand dollars worth of business for us in 1984 that figured had jumped to over a hundred fifty million. One product in a family member is family owned business in nineteen eighty four gay one product line. From one question three that she asked herself three decades earlier is generating over a hundred and fifty million in revenue a year. So i go back to her idea about the importance of making a family business she was completely in raptured and obsessed and completely this idea taken hold of her building this company. But she says i refuse to either choose business or family i wanted both and so this is a little bit about how they structured the business not only between themselves husband wife but also more importantly i think. Other young kids and i think the experience that they gave them you fast forward now both of her sons are still alive. Thank one is ninety one and one is eighty and they're both multi billionaires as a result of you know this this decision member going back to the very beginning the account and the lawyer don't do this don't do this. Thank god as they didn't listen anybody but herself and you fast forward eighty years later and look at how she changed the trajectory of her entire family. So as the business group cared very much about involving her sons lennard work at the office every day after school he delivered packages he was our first billing clerk and you type up every invoice. This is when he's in high school by the way and then he'd work full time for us are with us during every summer after high school he went to the warden school finance. At the university of pennsylvania and then after that he went to columbia graduate school of business. All while in college we had been sending him copies this is such a great idea all while in college we've been sending him copies of all the correspondence at sd lauter. So things like notes from distributors deals lost or made letters from customers financial statements positive and negative were all forward to him at school. And it was around this time where they get an acquisition offer and they're like well we received an offer to sell the business for a million dollars you know we're in nineteen fifties. And so they asked their son you know what should we do and i think it's obvious they didn't consider selling for one second. But he said you know million dollars doesn't sound like too much we should keep going and today the market cap somewhere around thirty billion dollars. And then when they want to expand into europe the way she does i think is really smart so she says i'm gonna start with the finest store in london which at the time was harrods. And she thought if i could get my products inside of her harrods and all the other great stores in europe would follow and so she goes and pitches the buyers at harrods the first meeting the buyer is simply not interested. And so as they does exactly what she does when she's in town to launch anything even though that this time she was unsuccessful getting into her products in there she goes and she says a little media attention was called for. I visited the beauty editors of various magazines and she convinced the beauty editor at harpers bizarre. To write a piece about her products and they agree but then they ask her okay well what store in london would were your products available. And she says my products are not available in london and she replies okay that's fine i'll write a piece saying that as a lotters cosmetics will be coming soon. The article comes out it's well received as they goes back to the buyer at harrods again i went. Again the answer was no there was no space at this time there was no call for my products this wasn't the right time of year maybe another time i had to keep trying. I stayed in england another month visiting every beauty editor to make my name known i was getting write ups but no order from harrods. The next year i go back to london and i go back to harrods she was not the buyer was not quite as hostile this time she says let me tell you i have no room but as i told you before. But perhaps i could take a tiny order and put it in with the general toiletries it won't be next to the good cosmetics that you'll have to understand. It was not a victory yet i visited everyone of the beauty editors again to remind them of me another round of make ups another round of samples do you think you might write another piece i asked the i asked them. Now they were in london and harrods the articles appeared customers also appeared women began asking for sd lauter the harrods buyer was reluctant to notice. But she had no choice in the flush of a good week sales i summoned up courage to ask if she could give me a more important counter oh no she said. Other counter space is definitely not available that's fine six months later i made a third trip to london i met with the buyer again well we seem to have many london women asking for your products she grudgingly admitted. I think i'll give you a small spot at a more prestigious counter and that is how sd lauter came to europe. This relentless way that she follows up this relentless way that she draws attention to her brands and gets other other people other customers to ask you know to the media. Through her own clientele is something she does over and over again so she wants to expand into canada the buyer at this department stores like no like the cosmetic department is is spoken for we have all these exclusives. And she's like okay well what not a cosmetic you need bath oil why don't you stock my youth do so she says you need a bath oil women would love to come into a department store instead of a drug store to buy it. Look buy it on consignment if you sell it fine if you don't you've lost nothing oh okay he said but send me just a few bottles and only the oil. You know she's not gonna do that so i was wrapping up the bath oil to send to canada i decided to put a few creams in with a note take these on consignment also you certainly wouldn't want to have to say no to any woman who asked if you have everything if you have anything else in this line right. And his response was what about our exclusive with other companies what about my lack of space what about what about what about he sputtered when i spoke with him later on look you must go with the trend and with the world. Everyone is using the bath oil and these creams in america you don't have to pay me for them until you sell them okay fine he said in resignation when i came to make a personal appearance at the opening of a lotter in canada my sales department had sent everything the bath oil the cologne the cream little boxes of powder i could give away is gifts we sold out of everything. The buyer came down to see me after three or four days how did you do this he said you don't sell cosmetic he responded you sell yourself. It all goes back to what she said i've never worked a day in my life without selling if i believe in something i sell it and i sell it hard she has an entire chapter. On selling it is not enough to have the most wonderful product in the world you must be able to sell it one person with definitive ideas and pride in their product and a hands on approach can lay the foundation for a strong business. Creating a great product is an accomplishment making people aware of its existence let alone getting them to try it is sometimes harder to do than to create it in the first place. Combine this with your unique philosophy about building a business is authentic to her goes back to what the gentleman in canada was saying oh you don't sell your products you sell yourself. This is what they said each business person was finest style that voice that grows clear and louder with each success and failure. Observing your own successes and failures make sure inner business voice more sure and vivid she continues and she states what she learned about building in beauty works for all products during the acquisition binges of the 1970s. We saw business firms becoming conglomerates there was pressure for us to do the same the lauter inner voice said no stick to what you know best and don't change it. Today the same firms are spinning off all the subsidiaries because they weekend instead of strengthening their original product the voice grows stronger with each success member that company building philosophy voice is what she's referencing. The voice grows stronger with each success each observed failure all one has to do is listen business is a magnificent obsession. I've never been bored a day in my life partly because as a true business addict it's never been enough to have steady work I had to love what I was doing love your career or else find another. Soup glue or beauty can all be packaged in jars tubes and bottles and all vended like any other commodity the big difference lies in the vendor the big difference lies in you not the items to be vended even excellent glues soups and beauty products can die in the marketplace if the vendor isn't passionate and clever develop your own style are unique style has come from years of trial and error. And this is two pieces of advice I think go well with each other visualize and then work like hell to make your visions a reality visualize if in your mind's eye you see a successful venture a deal made profit accomplished it is a superb chance of actually happening projecting your mind into a successful situation is the most powerful means to achieve goals if you spend time with pictures of failure in your mind you will orchestrate failure countless times before the event I have pictured a heroic sail to a large crowd. I went to the department store every step of the way and the picture in my mind became a reality I visualize success then created a reality from the image great athletes business people inventors and achievers from all walks of life seem to know this secret sounds really foo foo I'm just telling you it's in a bunch of the books Bob noise founder of Intel Edwin land Steve jobs Arnold Schwarzenegger Estee Lauder they all did this they all talked about doing this as well and then combine that with working like hell to make your dreams a reality I tend to work not stop during the day usually seven days a week and then at night she goes out at night about five times a week on average why it helps my business it keeps me in touch with the people who buy and sell my cosmetic cosmetics it keeps my finger on the pulse of my customers who are also the kind of people I choose as friends it's very useful to stay in close social contact with business associates those who are connected with my business life store owners buyers media people movie stars young career women are all involved on another level in my social life. And then finally she has some parting advice for you and I which is focus and don't quit first comes the wish then you must have the heart to have the dream then you work and work and work from where you sit you can probably reach out with comparative ease and touch a life of serenity and peace you can wait for things to happen and not get too sad when they don't that's fine for some but not for me serenity is pleasant but it lacks the ecstasy of achievement living the American dream has been intense difficult work but I couldn't have hoped for a more satisfying life I believe that potential is unlimited success depends on daring to act on dreams how far do you want to go go all the way within each person is the potential to build the empire of your wishes and don't allow anyone to say that you can't have it all I've always believed that if you stick to a thought and carefully avoid distraction along the way you can fulfill a dream my whole life has been about fulfilling dreams I keep my eye on the target whatever that target was I've never allowed my eye to leave the particular target of the moment whether your target is big or small grand or simple ambitious or personal I've always believed that success comes from not letting your eyes stray from the target anyone who wants to achieve a dream must stay strong focused and steady you must expect and demand perfection and never settle for mediocrity if you push yourself beyond the furthest place you can go you'll be able to achieve your heart's dream and that is where I'll leave it for the full story highly recommend reading the book if you buy the book using the link and the show notes are available founders podcast.com you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time that is three hundred and sixty one books down one thousand ago and I'll talk to you again soon.
