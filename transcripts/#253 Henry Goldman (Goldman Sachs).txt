Among the many letters of sympathy received by the family after Henry's death was one from Sydney Weinberg Who had been elevated to the position of partner in Goldman Sachs in 1927 and assumed the role of senior partner five years later Weinberg had started his career with the firm as a janitor's assistant an eighth grade dropout whose chores included Cleaning the office and brushing off the partners boots For a long time he was known around the office simply as boy But like Henry whom he greatly admired and viewed as one of the geniuses behind the success of Goldman Sachs Sydney was an excellent listener and an adaptive student in 1919 after he left the Coast Guard in which he served during World War one he approached Henry seeking a job Henry advised him to return to Goldman Sachs. That was where the opportunity lay. He said Demonstrating once again a canny talent for spotting human potential Henry offered to act as Weinberg's mentor and to introduce him to valuable context in the business world at Goldman Weinberg became a salesman of commercial paper for $28 a week plus 1.8 percent in commissions Henry advised him to ask for a bigger piece of the pie as his sales Escalated and he advanced to earning 33 percent commission at a time when the stock market was booming and In the 1930s Henry recommended and endorsed him for seats on many of the corporate boards on which he would serve for almost 40 years Weinberg joined Walter Sachs as a co-chairman of the firm became a trusted advisor to presidents and corporate chairman and was credited with Steering Goldman Sachs into a revitalized era of prosperity and stature That was an excerpt from the book. I'm going to talk to you about today Which is when money was in fashion Henry Goldman Goldman Sachs and the founding of Wall Street and was written by Henry's Granddaughter June Breton Fisher So I wanted to start with that excerpt that comes at the end of the book Henry had just died To prove a point that he was just doing an act of kindness that happened in that he was helping Sidney Weinberg in the 1920s He had already been forced out of the Goldman Sachs partnership So he didn't have any financial benefit to the wonderful career that Weinberg winds up going and having at Goldman Sachs over the next 40 years there's actually two additional resources I use to prepare for the podcast in addition to reading this book and One of them is this essay and I'll link down below in show notes for both of these But one of them is an essay that Mark Malcolm Gladwell wrote in 2008 it's called the uses of adversity and is about Sidney Weinberg story Henry Goldman makes an appearance in that essay as well I thought it was worth the time I invested in reading it and the second was an episode of a podcast its business breakdowns The title of the podcast is Goldman Sachs fortune favors the old and that episode is great because in an hour They give you an incomplete overview of the Goldman Sachs of today how they make money what businesses are involved in how the firm is organized Today so I want to jump right into the book There's this quote that's at the very first on the first chapter that I thought was fantastic And it comes from Walter Sachs who at the time was a senior partner of Goldman Sachs He said this in 1928 so this is about 11 years after Henry's forced out of the firm which I'll get to which was one of The most surprising parts of the book for me and Walter said men can learn from the past and I've been shocked How little some of the younger executives in the present firm know about its origins? They don't even know that my grandfather whose picture is on the wall there Founded the firm and that just speaks to why the book was written It's meant to catalog the history the very beginning of the firm It ends the story ends in like the 1920s 1930s And what is unique about this book is it kind of reads like a family diary So let's go to right to the beginning says my grandfather Henry Goldman was the son of a poor German immigrant Named Marcus Goldman Marcus Goldman is going to be the founder of Goldman Sachs And I've actually looked for biographies of Marcus Goldman in the past and haven't found any and I think the first part of this book Kind of serves as a brief overview of how Marcus got to America and how he's in it when he started What would eventually become Goldman Sachs and then the vast majority of the book is about Henry Goldman But I think this brief overview of Marcus's life was is very useful And so the note I left myself when I first read this part was this is how Goldman and Sachs actually meet this is happening in Bavaria and Marcus's father is his name is wolf So it says wolf was especially proud of his son mark who at the age of 16 had been encouraged by the schoolmaster To make periodic trips to the synagogue where the rabbi offered more advanced classes to outstanding students It was there that mark made the acquaintance of Joseph Sachs the 19 year old son of a poor saddle maker The two young men became fast friends never dreaming that their futures would be entwined for more than a century in a land They had yet to see and so Joseph Sachs keeps popping up in market in Marcus's life And I was like when are they gonna start this company together? I didn't realize that it's not that is not the Joseph Sachs is not the Sachs that is the Goldman Sachs It's going to be his son Marcus brings in Joseph's son and then once he brings him into the partnership that he's already started they rename the firm firm Goldman Sachs and so now we get to the point where Marcus's father actually advises him. Hey, you got to get out of Germany There's an opportunity here for you You need to go to America and this is why and it's gonna tie into another founder that I've covered in the past It had become increasingly apparent that there was no future for young Jewish men in Germany Wolf reluctantly concluded it was time for his eldest son who had just turned 27 to seek a new start in the United States The newspaper had been running stories almost every day about the grand opportunities available to newcomers in America a Recent article had told about a boy named Levi Strauss. This is back on founders number 33 Actually read pretty sure if I remember correctly It was the book written by the historian the company historian of Levi Strauss that tells his Levi's life story Which is absolutely fascinating So now think about this the future founder of Goldman Sachs his dad and him are reading newspaper articles about the opportunity and being Inspired by Levi Strauss's story That was remarkable to me a recent article told about a boy named Levi Strauss from a nearby village who had left the old world And soon afterward made a fortune sewing work pants for gold prospectors heading out west So Marcus does the trip across the Atlantic winds up in Philadelphia Bumps into Joseph Sachs who had moved there with his wife a few years earlier They were moving again because Joseph is going to he's a teacher He's gonna start a school and so I think he's going up to Boston or something like that He's like hey if you need a place to stay you can rent we're about to move you can rent our room This is the reason I'm bringing this up to you is because it talks about what Marcus was doing The jobs he had and that he had to take right coming to a brand new country Not a lot of money has to take any opportunity can get and just a sense of gratitude that he has which was really impressed me So he went to meeting his new landlady her son gives Marcus job her son Manfred had a little shop on the ground floor facing the street where he sold goods and tobacco But he had hopes of enlarging the business and peddling a wide range of goods from a horse-drawn wagon around the city He was looking for a strong reliable helper who could walk the streets Seven days a week and would not be afraid to work Regardless of rain or snow or the humid summer heat mark jumped at the chance and for the next year For the next three years rather he was sold textiles and spices and learned the language and customs of his adopted land Sometimes he would put in as many as 14 hours a day remember seven days a week the guy's working insane amount of hours Listen to his response which I found so impressive this he was courteous cheerful and popular among his customers in letters He in the letters he wrote to relatives in Germany. He always spoke of his good fortune and happiness And so he's doing this for three years And then we see immediately that Marcus has founder mentality other people might see a stream of immigrants coming in Arriving by boat from Europe every day He sees opportunity as he hawked his wares around along the river mark watched the newcomers arriving on steamships Steamships carrying all their goods and small suitcases and he recognized an enormous untapped market for sturdy Inexpensive clothing that was unfolding before his eyes. So this is the first business. He's ever gonna start He's telling his wife Bertha Bertha had also told him that she's seen a wonderful new invention being demonstrated downtown that day It was a sewing machine the two in less than ten minutes The two agreed to gamble on their first investment the next morning Marcus applied at the first Bank of the United States for a $5 loan to buy one he paid $2 down He used the balance of the loan to rent a storefront on a busy street where he started a new career as a tailor So Marcus was correct in identifying the massive opportunity. This business is gonna be very successful He's gonna run it over the next six years before he moves to New York and becomes a banker I want to at this point in in Marcus's life though. They're having children one of the the children That they have is Henry who was obviously gonna be the main focus of this book, right? And what was fascinating to me and this comes up over and over again is because Henry had a problem reading They thought he was dumb and so it says Henry had been slow learning to read It was finally determined that the youngest that that the youngster rather Suffered from a stigmatism and hit and his chores in the shop were limited to fetching and carrying clothes From the store room are fastening the shutters at closing time His mother was convinced he would never succeed in a competitive world and was inclined to coddle and baby him and This is a main point in Henry's life this idea that other people saw him as deficient because he had trouble reading He wants to going blind his eyes like they get worse and worse his eyesight gets worse and worse over time eventually at the end of life it sounds to me that he's almost completely blind and even this this is important the reason I'm bringing this up to you is because That is why it's not called Goldman and Goldman and it's called Goldman Sachs his own father Marcus didn't think that Henry was capable enough and so when he was when it was time to pick a partner He chose his son-in-law. So that's another thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs They were you know, it starts with this deep friendship between Joseph Sachs and Marcus Goldman. They wind up intermarrying There's a button. It's so confusing. There's like so many this family tree is so crazy But a lot of them are marrying each other and so when Marcus chooses his son-in-law over his son Henry uses that as fuel He had a deep desire to prove people wrong and it turns out he's really really smart It's just he has to learn to do listening. He has like this superpower of this listening superpower. He uses through his entire life He's just not he's not gonna be able to see he can't even see the page. You can't read So let's get to the point where Marcus again founder mentality always chasing opportunities over the next years six years his store thrived But Philadelphia began to lose some of its steam as an economic center as as an economic economic center as the Civil War wound down so we're in 1869 this is the point in history New York had replaced it as a commercial and cultural center and money making it investing it Exchanging it was the engine that was propelling its growth Marcus's wife prodded her husband to take his profits and relocate to New York the city of progress where Opportunities seem limitless. So we've already seen hey I'll make the jump from Bavaria to America to chase opportunity. I'll make the jump from Philadelphia to New York I'm going to chase opportunities exhibiting once more an extraordinary ability to reinvent himself and adapt to a new environment a Trait that would define his success over the years Marcus sold his share of the business and set out for new horizons And so the very beginning of the firm that will eventually turn into Goldman Sachs benefit is benefiting from a financial boom Growing customer base and that there's no barriers to entry this blew my mind because this is exactly we live in almost the exact opposite Scenario today in terms of how difficult it is to start a new bank today In 1869 gold was flowing into New York from California and vast numbers of immigrants were arriving on ships from Europe almost every day This provided a potential Growing potential clientele for bankers at the time check this out at the time no qualifications or special training were needed to enter the banking business and Then we see Marcus just like every other all of history's greatest entrepreneurs were studying the Successful entrepreneurs that came before them, so he's inspired by this guy named Joseph single seek see ligman I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name correctly so it says following examples of established German Jewish bankers like Joseph Siglum in who came from a similar background as Marcus and had become very very rich in a relatively short period of time Marcus hung out a shingle advertising himself as M Goldman banker And so this is a description of the the very first business that he does he considered herself a banker and a broker of IOUs For the tanners and droolers in this district in Manhattan known as the swamp by buying This is what he was doing by buying promissory notes at a discount in the morning and selling them to banks in the afternoon He enabled merchants to raise short-term working capital That's very fascinating because Henry's what Henry Goldman is credited with his innovation for Goldman Sachs Was getting the company into into IPOs of new firms that were consolidating and expanding their businesses That is where he's going to that that is where Henry is going to make his fortune This is what what Marcus is doing the late the notes later came to be known as commercial paper He conducted his business on foot and so this line gives you an insight into Marcus's personality Won't come as a surprise to somebody that was working seven days a week 14 hours a day and grateful for that opportunity Marcus was anxious to capitalize on every waking hour So Joseph Sachs Marcus's friend had started this prep school. That was really difficult and that is where Henry's are assuming Marcus's sons Henry and Julius are going to go Says Henry and his brother attended the Sachs collegiate Institute for boys Which was founded by the Goldman's old friend Joseph Sachs which was considered the city's number one college preparatory school in this description of Joseph Sachs Sachs was a gifted teacher but famously short on patience He would come down on you like a ton of bricks if you were ever caught slacking Henry remembered and so this is the first part of the book where I realized oh Henry's not dumb He just needed to find the best way that he learned the way he learned best and that was by listening Henry was an attentive listener Who committed everything he heard in school and much that he heard outside of the classroom to memory? He does so well in school. He gets admitted to Harvard. He's gonna have to drop out though He was granted admitted to Harvard But his eyesight had become so poor that he no longer felt capable of keeping up with his studies and he dropped out Leaving the world of academia forever It was a bitter blow that fate had handed him especially when he realized that his father's dreams for him would be shattered This is what the point that the author makes that the fact is they saw this as like the Disability that would prohibit for him from ever having a successful career in business Marcus too straightforward to disassemble his disappointment wondered out loud What kind of career could be cobbled together for this son of his? And so at this point of the book the author is already now transferred over We're gonna see the end of Marcus's career and end of Marcus's life with the beginning of Henry's Career and really his career in business and just what he does really smart like you can't control people's other people's impressions of you He didn't think he was as dumb as his father made of thought or he didn't think he that he was incapable of being Successful in business as his father thought but hit how he responds that is really really clever. So let's get to their first This was a mark at Marcus's 60th birthday This is when he's going to start Goldman Sachs After the toast of the at the birthday have been offered and the candles on the cake Estinguished Marcus asked for a moment of silence again. We see more of his gratitude He spoke of the amazing turns and the road of his life that his life had taken Since he had left Germany 30 years before and of his joy and being surrounded by such a wonderful family most of which have been now intermarried with Joseph Sachs his family and Then he and then he invited his son-in-law Sam to join him in the business we'll get to more about this but Sam and Henry are going to be partners and they hate each other like this I had no idea that the Goldman and Sachs is the two families wind up not speaking for like a hundred years There's just crazy stories in the book about that. I've always believed that Henry So now this is obviously the author who is the granddaughter of Henry talking about her grandfather I've always believed that Henry was seen by his father as unable to manage such a role because of his physical ailment While Marcus decision was based on what he thought was common sense and not emotion It was a crushing blow to Henry. How could it not be? Imagine like stop here for a second. Just put yourself in the shoes of Henry like your father starts his firm go It's about to be turned called and turned into Goldman Sachs. It's doing really well really successful You want like you have a good relationship with him? You want to follow in his footsteps you're interested in finance and he chooses your brother-in-law A year and a half passed and Marcus was so pleased with Sam's performance that he asked him to become his partner from then on The firm was known as Goldman Sachs Henry was still shocked that he had been passed over He was dumbfounded by then he was in his mid 20s. And so Henry, you know could have said oh, what was me? Could have just given up. He's like, okay, that's fine He sets out trying to build his own career And so he becomes a traveling salesman and this is the reason this was really smart is because he winds up learning sales Learning people and then learning the value of listening and the advantage it gives him over so many other people He became a traveling salesman of textiles. It must have been a lonely life traveling cross-country in the 1870s but it afforded Henry the time he needed for introspection and observation and as it turned out the experience provided an education So he's traveling all over the country on this relatively new technology of the day, which is the railroad the railroads, right? And so that gets him out of New York and he gets to see how other people are conducting business Henry was able to see beyond his reflection in the dark window and to gain a bird's-eye view of the mom-and-pop retailers the little machine shops the small-town banks that were popping up all across the country and so it says as the railroads Were carrying him from New York to Philadelphia to Boston to Chicago and st Louis he was able to overhear the ramblings and rumblings of his fellow passengers Most of whom were also in trade and to learn what people outside of New York were thinking and talking about this experience turned him into a Consummate observer that made me think of I think it was episode 212 I read like a six or six hundred or seven hundred page biography of Michael Jordan I find myself thinking a lot about that book actually, but there's something that Michael said in that book which was fantastic And he says that successful people listen and those who don't listen don't survive long And I think if we could go back and ask Henry Goldman his opinion of that quote He would agree with it and then spread all throughout the book over hundreds of pages There's just these like one lines that give you an insight into Henry Goldman's personality. This is the first one I'm just gonna go ahead and read a bunch of random lines to you. This this is the first one now He was somewhat of a loner comfortable with his own company Here's another one he had important matters on his mind and he was not one to waste time on small talk he was extremely averse to publicity and Then I like this one because it was Henry's advice to his sons when he was about to die Ultimately, we have to set our own criteria for what constitutes failure and what constitutes success. It's not the same for everyone So he's a traveling salesman for many years. I think he starts out in his mid-20s and then he winds up working in the firm He finally gets invited into the firm, but as a junior partner, so he's underneath his brother-in-law, right? So says in 1885 Henry was finally invited into family But only as a junior partner the firm's name was then changed to Goldman Sachs and company and from then on also I want to bring this up to you because the unique structure in the way that the firm was organized So it says and then from then on for almost 50 years All of Goldman Sachs partners were members of were members of the intermarried families Their assets are a major portion of their assets were tied up in the firm and provided working capital as well as savings The practice continued until Goldman went public over a hundred years later making it an extraordinarily Profit oriented organization the partners were never allowed to withdraw any of their money Without making a formal petition to the senior partners So that may explain that unique structure may explain why he was still living at home when he was 33 years old there were no Exceptions to this rule this may have explained why Henry was in no hurry to move out to a home of his own Even as he approached the age of 33 because it sounded like all of his wealth was tied up into the firm, right? And so for 10 years, he's gonna work as a junior partner Why his father and Sam Sam Sachs are the senior partners and then it goes into something that just blew my mind So it talks about at this point, you know, they're obviously all intermarried the patriarch of the family still alive He Marcus is kind of keeping everybody together once he dies This is gonna be like the Civil War that happens So it says in later years this occasion the social occasion would be remembered as one of the last times that the Saxons and the Goldman's would gather on a social basis who could have guessed that this close-knit Intermarried family who was also doing business together would soon be enmeshed in a feud Drenched in such animosity that the members and their children would not exchange a word for almost a hundred years And so once Henry's forced out of the partnership seems to me like it reads if you read between the lines I don't say this but it seems like he was forced to resign and I'll get into why that was the case but he never talked to his partner again and Henry was like a hard dude. He kept a grudge. And so let me read this section This comes at the very end I think on the last page of the book and it talks about where the fact that the the the families previously had built final resting places in the cemetery and so the Goldman's did this and the Sax did this and Henry picked a spot where his back was turned to the sax so it says in his final resting place Henry had built for himself and his heirs It was larger and grander and its back is turned on the saxes in death as in life So there is no happy ending it's not like oh we had a big fight and then we reconciled no they hated each other till death So says Henry bided his time still playing a watchful waiting game It wasn't until his father stepped aside two years later that he was finally elevated to the same level of authority as Samuel When it when it did happen, he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday So it's about ten years as a junior partner and after years of being made aware that he was expected to fail He was determined to achieve a role of leadership and dominance and Prove all the predictions wrong So it's very clear Henry Goldman had fire in his belly and used people doubting him as fuel and so a way to think about what's happening now is Sam and Henry wanted being great and Terrible partners and it's a shame that they couldn't resolve their personal differences because I think they would have had more success They were able to stay together There was like Goldman had this almost near-death experience that actually Malcolm Gladwell writes in that essay that I linked below Where they they went up using there's this guy that comes in winds up using a lot of leverage I think that he grows their assets to like 500 million or something like that And then a financial panic happens to think they'd go down all the way down to like 10 million or something like that It's in the essay, but it's not in the book, but I thought that was very interesting So anyways, the new partners were polar opposites They found it difficult to agree on anything Sam was a was suspicious of everyone and worried all the time He was deferential to the establishment meaning the other houses financial houses in Wall Street at this time and in London Henry's much more of like has more of an entrepreneurial bend He envisioned Sam envisioned that the Goldman Sachs of the future as an international banking concern and harbored ambitious to expand the firm's currency dealings Overseas, so that's actually a good role that he played They they went about having separate strengths Which again, that's very valuable if they could have stayed together He was a hard worker, but he was never known to have an original streak Sam met his match in Henry now They're gonna compare in contrast the two personalities and their approach to work Sam met his match in Henry who was stubborn and immutable in all His convictions Henry was a creative ambitious risk-taker and his forte was trading railroad bonds Which were the hottest commodity of the time he proved to be an extremely successful Speculator and he winds up adding about five million dollars to the company's balance sheet over a ten-year period which would be an Insane amount of money to this day as new businesses started up every day and the distribution of goods So it's talking about like what is the technological impact that the railroad is having I've mentioned this over and over again I've read a bunch about the railroad founders You could there's a lot of analogies there between the railroad network in the late 1800s early 1900s and the internet of today as new Businesses started up and check this out because if you read this this pair or if you listen to this paragraph about to read you it almost sounds like they're describing the internet as New businesses started up every day and the distribution of their goods was being Revolutionized by the rapid spider webbing of railroads across the country Henry was itching to get into the action But Sam shrank away from that plan so Henry wants to invest in the new technology of his day, which is the railroad, right? So this is really gonna set the tone like the beef that Henry and Sam have forever How they wind up how Goldman Sachs grows to partnering partnering with other firms in London and how they made money Neither Sam nor Henry could ever admit that he was wrong in 1897 on one of his frequent trips to Europe seeking to expand Goldman's currency exchange business Sam was interested. This is something smart that Sam does because this relationship He's about to build for Goldman Sachs was extremely lucrative. This also is gonna cause Henry being asked to resign about 20 years after the fact, I think it happens in 1917 if I remember correctly Sam was introduced to Kleinwort and sons at that time They were one of London's most revered merchant revered merchant banks The senior Kleinwort partners were very very rich and also high in the pecking order of British society Which impressed Sam Henry gives me the impression that he wanted the money So I haven't got to why that the book is named when money was in fashion, but it's fantastic Because it has to do with his personal motto So it sounds like to me that Henry is more interested in getting very very rich where Sam wanted to be rich But he would also wanted to be like respected in society So says they they were eager Kleinworth that is they were eager to develop business and commercial credits and for foreign exchange in America With the British flush with cash and the Americans giving birth to one brand new industry after another a joint venture With them with Goldman Sachs promised rich rewards for both partners first, excuse me both parties a Collaboration was brokered check who check who's brokering this deal. This is hilarious. It's the Rothschild's So says the collaboration was brokered by the Rothschild's wealthy agent in New York who vouched that Goldman Sachs quote is one of the firms About whom nobody can say anything against so there was a similarity that popped in my mind when I was reading this book If you go back to the founding of the Rothschild's like banking empire So you have the founder who's extremely poor he builds it up to you know, it's rather successful But then it's his son that takes it to another level So if you think about mayor Rothschild Playing the role of Marcus Goldman in this story and then Nathan Rothschild playing the role of Henry Goldman If you don't know I'm talking about I did a two-part series It's 197 founders 197 which covers the biography of the founder of Rothschild and then 198 really talks about a lot about what Nathan and the rest of the family like how they expand Their banking empire and so there is some Some similarities between the two stories in my opinion So let's go into the business they're doing and how they're making money Goldman Sachs set up a foreign exchange department to increase their bond arbitrage and Commercial paper businesses and the Kleinwurt's would provide letters of credit for companies which was a new and very profitable addition to their services However, it was in the field of lending money to developing businesses that both companies Really made a killing I double underlined that section I'm gonna reread it again because you can think of this is like the Henry central idea He's gonna take this to another level It was the field of lending money to developing businesses that both companies really made a killing But Henry finds himself in a pickle because the Sachs's the actual family members that have the last name Sachs's are actually Expanding at a faster rate than the Goldman's in the business they're gonna wind up having all the power a new bone of contention arose between the brothers-in-law when Sam hired his brother Harry and Then his son Paul and elevated them to positions equal to Henry's Henry viewed the imbalance of power and money between the two branches of the family as thoroughly unjust and Then all hell breaks loose because his dad's gonna die after Marcus passed away all pretenses of brotherly love Evaporated and the partners no longer tried to conceal their innermost feelings And I found this part very interesting because it's Henry It's Sam telling Henry no that actually leads to Henry developing a specialty in IPOs IPOs rather and so it says Henry expressed to his partners the conviction that underwriting railroad bonds was the road to the bank and He was he was determined to follow it the boom in railroad construction after the Civil War had transformed the country from an agrarian society to an industrial economy and produced tremendous money on Wall Street and then it lists all these other families and companies that Kind of have control over this railroad bond markets. You got the single Siglimans, which is the family that inspired Marcus to start his bank You got the house of Morgan which you and I have talked about before the Ross childs are in on this as well But really the part that jumped out of me is this guy named Jacob Schiff because this is an idea that I learned from David Ogilvy and he says the good ones no more and The idea behind that maxim I see over and over and over again the history of entrepreneurship I'm about to tell you how Jacob Schiff was one of the good ones that knew more I want to read where this idea came from all the way back on founders number 89. I read Ogilvy's Autobiography called confessions of an advertising man and he just lays the foundations like you don't have to be the smartest person This is this is an echo of Bill Gurley's fate Fantastic talk which is called running down a dream how to survive and thrive in a career that you love and he makes the point In that talk that you don't have to be the smartest person You can collect more information and other people in that just that act is so it's it's not that difficult But so few people do it and so that's something that David Ogilvy noticed, you know back in the 1960s He says listen, you must be ambitious and he's giving advice at this point. He's already super successful Right, and he only builds on the success over the next 20 years after the book is published But he's giving advice to you like the younger people and he's like do you want and he's like I'm gonna give you this advice And I know most of you are too lazy and pathetic to even do this First you must be ambitious set yourself up to becoming the best informed man in the agency on the account in which you are signed If for example, it is a gasoline account read textbooks on the chemistry geology and distribution of petroleum products Read all the trade journals in the field read all the research Reports and marketing plans that your agency has ever written on the product Spend Saturday mornings in service stations pumping gasoline and talking to motorists visit your clients refineries and research laboratories Study the advertising of all his competitors at the end of your second year He's saying this takes if you do this consistently in two years. That's not a long time Check this out study the advertising of his competitors at the end of your second year You will know more about gasoline than your boss You will then be ready to succeed him most of the young men in agencies are too lazy to do this kind of homework They remain permanently Superficial and it's funny. I'm looking at my read wise as I read that to you and the note I left myself I didn't even see this still just now the note I left myself when I read that it says Bill Gurley said you have zero excuse for not being the most knowledgeable person in any Subject you want and he's dead, right? So we see that with Jacob Schiff and this is they box out remember they box out Henry He's not gonna be able to this feels already dominated by other people So says they were soon joined these other banks were soon joined by this other bank called or I don't know their banks I guess they're like financial houses called Kuhn lobe and company whose youthful partner Jacob Schiff was Fascinated by railroad development in all the tramifications and became determined that his firm would dominate the field This is an example of good note good with the good ones no more There was not a facet of railroad investment or operation that Jacob did not carry in his head Good luck competing with somebody like that when Henry approached these giants who held a virtual lock on the business to announce his intentions They did not take kindly to this upstarts intrusion into their territory and made a counteroffer to buy out his railroad Investments at cost plus six percent interest in plain language He was not welcomed in their exclusive club and so Henry's like I don't care I'm gonna find a way in and it's Sam that overrules him Henry was always volatile and outspoken He was incensed and mince no words about it He insisted to Sam that Goldman Sachs should continue to pursue new railroad underwriting projects Especially west of the Mississippi where some of these other brand some of these other how like financial houses were not doing as much business Sam as usual disagreed arguing that he did not wish to antagonize the major players of the day So Sam says no this leads Henry looking for other opportunities the very next day Henry met his best friend Philip Lehman you will recognize all these last names for lunch in the back room upstairs at Delmonico's And so it says a Lehman family had also found a very founded a very successful bank The Lehman name was synonymous with money so Phil like Henry is going to be the son of the founder Like Henry Phil was an assertive competitive personality driven to achieve success in whatever he undertook He had led Lehman Brothers into financing developing the American potash and chemical corporation Which eventually sold at a huge profit to the Standard Oil Company, you know I've just done a bunch of podcasts the Henry Flagler podcast and I reread Titan If you haven't listened to those if you want to learn more about the Standard Oil Company It's amazing how all these stories kind of linked together one way or the other So they're having dinner or lunch. What was it lunch? Does it even matter? They're at the Monica's having some steaks drink Smoking some cigars and so they're like, hey, why don't we do that more of that? So says they discussed a remarkable number of family-owned businesses that were turning to Wall Street to raise capital for expansion Henry observed that they represented a unique Untapped investment opportunity not very different if you think about the use of language there of his father walking around Trying to sell goods next to the river and be like man What are all these people coming over to coming off the boats into a new country need? Why don't I start a tailoring business? So it says they represented Henry observed they represented a unique untapped investment opportunity What would Phil think about diverting some of Lehman's capital from commodity exchanges to underwriting issues for new companies? So if you think about that This time Lehman has a lot more money than Goldman Sachs at this time in history Goldman Sachs now we obviously know Lehman's gone and Goldman Sachs is one of the wealthiest financial institution on the planet You can learn more about that by listening to that episode. I was telling you about at the beginning of the podcast fortune favors the old which I thought was a fantastic title, but it's just Mind-blowing when they talk about all the different businesses there and just how much money there they interact with it's just it's inconceivable to me Goldman Sachs would come up with the clients and Lehman the money with the two sharing profits 50-50 this agreement was sealed with a handshake and it lasted for over 20 years So this is an example of the company like the kind of companies they were doing this for this was the very first one That they would take public their first their first underwriting was the United cigar company Which had previously been opened by a brother by a pair of brothers and they started with just one tiny cigar store The business thrived and grew and additional workers were employed Within 15 years they wind up taking over several other tobacco mint tobacco firms and they consolidated under the name of United cigar manufacturers The reason they came to Lehman and Goldman is because they need money to build more factories and employ a larger sales force 20 million dollars was what they were looking for and so first they wanted they came to Goldman to get a loan and says Henry foresaw A perfect situation to test the viability of this new theory Marketing the shares for the United cigar company took a little bit more time a great deal the preferred stock was sold in Europe through their partnership with Kleinwort and Then as you can imagine a book that covers like the economic history of the America in the late 1800s early 1900s There's a ton of these financial panics I want to give you a quick overview of a financial panic that ends in suicide and the reason I think this is important is Because this still like goes on to this day I've heard of people in this latest crash killing themselves and it's just completely unnecessary For some reason humanity has this flaw where we just refuse to learn from the past So this is a brief overview. This goes on for several pages I'm just gonna pull out some some what I feel are the most important parts In in 1907 a panic occurred in the previous 10 years There had been a dramatic increase in the number of small investors in the market Remember this book is written in 2010. It sounds like it could be written and in present day So in 1907 a panic occurred in the previous 10 years There had been a dramatic increase in the number of small investors in the market and a shift in interest from bonds to stocks Everyone wanted to get in on the action of Wall Street where the easy money lay and so one of this this main thing that that pops off for the the financial panic of 1907 is This Nickenbacher trust company. So the Nickenbacher trust company was considered emmettly successful and Among the most trusted In the city you already know where the story is going if they started like that While its primary business was to act as a trustee for wealthy individuals Corporations and estates it also issued interest-bearing certificates of deposit and offered checking facilities I wonder what they're gonna do with that money. The press reported that its capital was intact and secure Oh my god, the press being wrong about something that must have happened for the first time in history But there was a dirty little secret in the back rooms of Nickenbacher Heinz these are the founders and the controllers Heinz and his brother Otto and the bank president Barney Remember Barney because he's about to pop his own top Heinz his brother Otto and the bank president Barney had been speculating with the depositors funds Oh my goodness in an attempt to corner the market in United copper shares and their manipulation had fallen on its face Government bonds at the time had to be deposited with the Treasury in order to obtain banknotes and the supply of government bonds at Nickenbacher was insufficient to cover a depositors run on the bank Panic occurred when the public found out about the situation a panic that threatened not only Wall Street But also the entire financial fabric of the city and the nation itself Money had simply dried up when I got to that line. It made me think of what back on episode 243 Francis Greenberger winds up as like a high school dropout winds up becoming a billionaire real estate developer and investor in New York and That book is his autobiography. It's like 40 or 50 years of real estate investing in the city of New York and He goes through multiple booms and busts and he just he perfectly Summarizes why he keeps this huge fortress of cash and he says markets can turn on a dime You might think oh, it's gonna drop by, you know a couple percentage points over maybe a few months No, it's oh, he's like literally overnight it dries up And so it says money had simply dried up the panic quickly spread from one bank to another Nickerbocker's funds were completely wiped out in 48 hours Barney shot himself and the reason I bring that up is because that happened then it'll happen today And unfortunately it'll happen in the future and if you've been paying attention to this podcast and you obviously know the greatest Entrepreneurs that have ever lived optimize for survival So Henry spots another opportunity at this point in history Department stores are rather a new concept and he's gonna take a bunch of these public Henry immediately saw the huge potential of gathering a number of retailers under one name pulling their purchasing power and Implementing a cooperative marketing push across the country. He recognized it as a landmark approach to modern marketing that Would benefit the consumer as well as the investor and agreed to float an issue So this is you know, this is the world that we live in but it was relatively new at this point They were in about the 19. I think we're a couple years after the panic So I think we're right around 1911 1912 Soon the names of famous department stores owned and operated by this family that that Henry's helping Were strung out like Christmas lights across the country and a lot of these companies They were founded many decades before and they don't wind up doing this public issuing till later on and they use it mainly for expansion Woolworth's isn't is a Is an example of this which was fascinating the story about to tell you It's this is it like how humble the origins were and a hundred years later This winds up becoming the largest department store in the world. So it's this guy named Woolworth didn't give up on his idea in in 1879 he opened a second store in which all the merchandise was priced at ten cents His concept was to purchase goods directly from the manufacturers and sell them to the public at fixed discounted prices Undercutting the offerings of local merchants. So those are his competitors of the day And again, this is a basic idea that that we've seen over and over again at the time. It was new It's like let me the main point here is like you can analyze existing markets and realize hey There's always opportunity by doing things slightly different and Woolworth's an example of that So he says listen out by the goods directly from the manufacturers I'll sell them to the public at fixed discounted prices. I'll undercut the offerings of my competition He displayed everything so that customers could make a selection for themselves Eliminating the need for a clerk to fetch and carry stock from behind the counter that his operation was cost and time effective He proceeded to open a large chain of stores across the country in 1912 when Woolworth's became a publicly traded company the synonym for five and tens I've heard of this is called five and dimes I think that's what Sam Walton described this concept as but it says Woolworth's became a synonym for five and tens and they were recognized as one of the hottest commercial phenomenon of the 20th century Another company that Henry's gonna help take public is Studebaker. This was very fascinating. I've obviously heard the name But I didn't know the background I didn't know was run by a bunch of brothers and he's gonna wind up sitting on their board for quite a while So this is really just an overview of the Studebaker brothers and their business Goldman Sachs issued stock in Studebaker Which is the first automobile manufacturer to go public the company was founded by four brothers who had migrated to California in the 1850s to make wheelbarrows for miners during the gold rush when they returned to the Midwest six years later They invested their earnings in the manufacturing of wagons which were widely success We're choosing which were widely used in settling the American West. So they have this this they seem to have this Vesis that in a gold rush you should sell pickaxes, right? They were extremely successful and became one of the largest wagon manufacturers in the world Supplying the United States Army throughout the Civil War They eventually switched to horse draw from horse drawn to electric powered vehicles And then just two years later, they introduced gasoline powered cars And then we get to something that one of Henry's mentors our student mentees said He's on good relationships with some of the saxes So this guy Walter Sachs is gonna wind up taking over the company as well and working with Sydney Weinberg as well But he's hearing this this conversation is taking place between Walter and somebody else who says He's trying to sell stock to this guy named. Mr. Strasbury So mr. Strasbury is one of the people I offered the stock to and he turned it down Walter related some months or a year Later the stock had doubled in value Fresh kid that I was I said to mr. Stalsbury. You should have bought that stock for me You'd have doubled your money Stalsbury responded my dear young man. I can't make money in everything Henry chuckled when he heard this but we can always try He said just keep in mind money is always in fashion. So that's his personal motto He repeats it over and over again. It's the name of the book money is always in fashion and so a few chapters later, they make the point like this opportunity that Goldman and Lehman wind up seizing it was an opportunity hiding played plain sight It was a segment of the market that was ignored by the established financial houses because they didn't think it was prestigious enough So really this is just a standard not a standard like a very important idea from the history of entrepreneurship is like you can find opportunities lurking where your competitors are just not paying attention and The greatest way like the greatest story the most distinct story I know to relate that idea is what William Randolph Hearst did to build his massive media empire which started with just one newspaper in San Francisco Him and the four or five other newspapers are all doing distribution selling their newspapers the same way they hire little boys called newsies to go on the street and sell Copies of newspaper by hand he realized hey people in San Francisco people that live in the city San Francisco They're not like unique. They're just humans humans everywhere want access to news When the markets and sports and world news Why don't it instead of just trying to out compete and just do the same thing everybody else is doing? I'll just put my newspapers on a new technology of the day Which is railroads and I'll send them out to all these cities that are surrounding the city of San Francisco And he opened up a completely new market because none of his competitors were doing that so says the new issues co-led by Goldman Sachs 114 of them so this is where Henry's made all his money kept spinning out like a river of gold Who cared if the other investment houses considered the retail sector short on cachet and long on risk The average man Henry knew had money in his pocket, so where is he gonna spend that money? He's gonna spend it with retailers right cleverment, and then it talks about Building up like finding unique ways to sell and market your product Clever manufacturers recognize that product development and marketing were becoming almost indistinguishable That this is a shoe company just they sell shoes and look look at this like they Basically combine entertainment with commerce the Brown shoe corporation pioneered the use of entertainment as a marketing tool and turned itself into a National brand mixing showbiz into their sales pitch. They're selling shoes for God's sake They employed a troupe of actors who were there's like this popular cartoon strip of the day So there's actors that were playing roles in there and sent them around the country to perform in vaudeville houses and on busy street corners singing and dancing and telling jokes and playing tricks and selling shoes by 1913 the company's advertising savvy had turned it into the largest manufacturer of children's shoes in the world and marked another success for Goldman Sachs list of publicly owned retail giants So Henry had a deep love of Germany this is gonna cause his breakup with his partners during World War one because obviously America and Britain are on the opposite side of the war and Henry didn't want to get really involved. He loved traveling and spending time in Europe He was kind of like a vagabond or a nomad couldn't stay in one place at one time One place for very long even after he retired he lives for like another 20 years He just constantly gallivanting around the world even as he's losing his sight But what I was interesting he had a really close call with death and he was supposed to book passage passage on the Lusitania which we know gets torpedoed so says His wife was fearful for Henry safety when he declared he would conduct business as usual and pay his annual visit To Europe in the spring of 1915 during the war is already popping off. It's very interesting decision you have here Henry There had been repeated reports of German U-boats torpedoing Torpedoing unarmed ships, but Henry was skeptical because he had like you just had this love of Germany But Henry was skeptical insisted he would sail on the elegant ship to Lusitania at the last minute She persuaded his wife persuaded him to delay the trip She had heard of a wonderful camp and house and acres that was for sale in the Adirondack Mountains Where they could share vacations with their children? Would you please go with me and at least look this over? He agreed and so he went up not booking passage and not dying And so then we get into the part that surprised me the most I did not know that he was forced out So think about like Goldman and then Sachs are on opposite sides of who they support for World War one And this is gonna wind up leading to Henry having to resign Henry turned the idea down flat repeating that he intended to support Germany not Britain in France dilemma now presented itself as the firm had two ironclad bylaws that had been mandated by Marcus Goldman from the outset the first was to support its new issues with the partners own money The other was that Goldman Sachs could only make an investment if all the partners were in agreements Henry's partners and his sisters who are and his sisters are married to the Saxes and so when they have the breakup He never speaks to his sisters again either his partners and his sisters were were embarrassed by his views and urged him to cool down his rhetoric Henry stuck to his guns and continued to speak out publicly about Germany's virtues Sam his partner would tell anyone who listened that Henry's statements were Purly personal and by no means representative of the beliefs and loyalties of the firm, but the damage was done headlines castigated the firm repercussions were swift with the firm's London partners the Klein words call cabling to say that if the ill feelings generated by Henry's remarks Was so great that they had become persona non grata in England meaning Goldman Sachs had become persona non grata in England The Bank of England then forbade the Klein words from participating in underwriting This company called the jewel tea company And they did this this is the first time that ever happened because they were not This is they were forbade to do this because of Henry's support for Germany And this is the first time that the Klein words were not involved in a Goldman Lehman new issue Doesn't stop there Klein words were then called before the Ministry of Blockade Where they were shown a large numbers the large number of interstate Intercepted cables showing that Goldman had been involved in an active exchange of business with Germany The Klein words professed to be frankly astonished and withdrew from any further exchange business with with their longtime friends until after the war and This is what forces them out the last straw came with the Klein words Called or cable to express alarm and newspaper articles in London that put Henry's sentiments on public record They warned that Goldman Sachs was in danger of being blacklisted in the city Henry realized at last that he was placing the firm's future in jeopardy and this is what he said since many months I've been revolving in my mind to withdraw from active business life I am not in sympathy with many trends which are now shaping public opinion The world's war has deeply affected my viewpoint of life My partners have been good enough to make to make my withdrawal from the firm possible I retire with the best of feelings towards the firm and all of its members That's a lie with which I have been associated for 35 years And to which I've given all that is in me that has got to be devastating if you've ever read There's been a number of examples on the podcast where people are either forced out They lose control of their business or they sell their business and they regret selling it and it's just devastating It's it's it's heartbreaking to them this was idea where it's like you've dedicated 35 years a ton of your life energy and you don't even have control over whether or Not you get to keep doing that. That's just that's a cautionary tale to me. And so Sam Sachs Henry's partner his his nephew Walter was actually close with With Henry and he didn't want to see him go. He says my god Walter said to himself What have we gotten ourselves into and this is why he was asking that question What have we gotten ourselves into as the Sachs who had always been closest to Henry the partner who realized the great debt that Goldman Sachs is success owed to Henry's dynamic personality and creative genius the colleague Henry mentored and Repeatedly reminded that money is always in fashion He had the most realistic assessment of the consequences the firm would suffer and felt the greatest sense of personal loss in His memoirs he recalled that Henry was an extraordinary Personality the original genius in Goldman Sachs who made the first great imaginative contribution to the growth of the firm Henry and Samuel Sachs never spoke again. Neither did Henry and his sister Louisa Sachs his wife the generations that follow never even made one another's acquaintance until almost a hundred years had passed And so Henry lives for another 20 years. I would say he never retired He's still investing like his own money still working with a ton of people still traveling the world having these unique experiences But he towards the end of his life He knew he was dying because he's slowly dying of heart failure And so there's a couple ideas from this point of his life I think you and I can learn from as Henry viewed his imminent mortality His thoughts could not help reverting to the Goldman Sachs He had known and helped build to greatness years before it was starting to make a comeback But it would be a long haul the Great Depression had swept away much of its capital reserves that the firm lost in the catching Trusts that story's told to Malcolm Gladwell essay that I have linked in the show notes But he held no sympathy for them and this part is really important I double-edged aligned it and it really gives you an insight into who Henry Goldman was they had relied on the decisions of others which he himself would never have done His only concern was the restoration of Goldman Sachs is good name and the reputation and the public's faith in its integrity and Then because he knows he's dying he talks about with his wife what his biggest regret is Henry shared that his greatest regret was that he had never developed a greater rapport with his children He thought that he had an inability to express approval to overlook their minor slip-ups and to embrace them and say I love you And that part is devastating because at that point in your life. There's nothing you can do to fix that regret I don't want to go to my grave with that regret Henry's death came without much fanfare in much the same low-key style. He had maintained throughout his incredible life He and his beloved wife were marveling about their ability to read each other's minds Like old members of a symphony orchestra who had rehearsed together for years suddenly his head dropped to his chest and the conversation stopped a fabled life had ended for the Renaissance man whose ethics and morals never ran second to ambition and drive and Then the book ends with the granddaughter looking at a photo album of all the people that had passed away from both sides of the family And she says looking at images and the old photo albums It's hard to believe that all these people are gone now along with their smiles and songs will and wisdom and fears and hopes and I wanted to end there because I think that paragraph serves as a reminder that that is coming for all of us We have an obligation to live an incredible life for ourselves and the people that love us And that is where i'll leave it for the full story buy the book if you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes Your podcast player you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time The very best way to support the podcast is to give a gift subscription to a family member a friend or a colleague That link is as always is below in the show notes your podcast player and available founders podcast.com That is 253 books down 1 000 to go and i'll talk to you again soon
