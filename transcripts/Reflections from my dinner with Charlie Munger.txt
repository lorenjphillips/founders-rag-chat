What you're about to hear I have never released on this feed before earlier this year. I got to have dinner with Charlie Munger. I spent over three hours with them. Surely after that happened. I was asked the question. What did you learn from that experience and actually recorded my answer to that question. And so you're about to hear that recording now before we get to that I want to tell you one of the first thoughts that I had when I woke up this morning. I heard the news of Charlie passing away yesterday and I was actually surprised at one of the first things I thought about this morning was it was actually a quote of something that Sam Walton had said in his autobiography. Sam Walton said that he borrowed more ideas from sole price than anyone else and Sam was in the business of learning from other entrepreneurs. In fact in that same book he says everything that I've done I've copied from somebody else. I'm in the same business. That is why founders exist. I'm in the business of learning from other entrepreneurs and I realized this morning that I've borrowed more ideas for my own life and my own business from Charlie Munger than anyone else. Charlie's a hero to me. Charlie changed my life and I'm going to miss him. I hope you enjoy these notes from my dinner with Charlie Munger. What did you learn from having dinner with Charlie Munger in case you haven't seen it yet. I just made an episode. It's episode 295. It is about the book The Tao of Charlie Munger but it is also about the fact that I got invited to have dinner at Charlie Munger's house. I got to spend over three hours with him and I got to ask him any question. No limits like you could ask him whatever you wanted. And so the first thing that I learned is he's exactly as advertised. The Charlie that you see at the Berkshire meeting, the Charlie that you've maybe watched speeches on, the Charlie that you've read books on. That is the same guy. He really does read all the time. His bookshelves were filled when he says hey you should become friends with the imminent dead. He's a biography nut. I thought you know close to 300 biographies for the podcast so far. He makes me look like a biography amateur. He had books on his shelves and don't worry he let me look through his shelves and I'm going to order a bunch of these books. They're really hard to find. I've already tried to track a bunch of them down. But he lives what he preaches. The fact that hey you should become friends with the imminent dead. The fact that you should find what you're good at and you should pound away at it forever. It took him 41 years to find his life's work. But once he became a full time investor he knew that that's what he was going to do for his whole life. He's just obsessed with it. He loves this idea where he could design his own schedule. He never wanted to have people to manage a bunch of people. He wanted to read all the time and make money with his mind. And so while I was with Charlie it was so incredible to be able to meet one of your heroes. He had a heavy influence. I've stolen so many of his ideas that I had prepared a list in advance of a ton of questions and things that I wanted to talk to him about. I never looked at my phone once. So the way I'm going to answer this question is what I did is when I got back to my hotel after I knew I was like this you know Charlie Munger this is like a night Charlie Munger may never remember. Right. Because you think he's 99 years old think about all life experiences that this guy's had what's in his brain. Right. It's a night that he may never remember and it's a night I'll never forget. So I just wrote down like what are the things that I wanted to remember. And so to answer this question I just want to run through some of my notes with you. So this is like one main theme. What's interesting about Charlie is like a lot of his ideas interact with each other and they combine and they become even more powerful. It's like this Lollapalooza effect that he talks about all the time. So what I would say is like the main thing that I took away from the dinner that I think is something I've already tried to put in practice. It's really important to me like something that clicked when I was reading. It's episode 286. I think the book is called has a terrible title. All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I won't go there. But while I was going through the words of Charlie and Warren Buffett in that book something clicked and I think it clicked with a lot of people because when you put a podcast out right. I just do these things by myself and then I release it and I have no idea what the reception will be. And what's interesting to me is like people will pick up on specific lines and like those lines will resonate far and above everything else you said in the podcast. And so something I said on that podcast that clicked for a lot of people and click for me was that learning is not memorizing information. Learning is changing your behavior. If I spent all this time reading about Charlie Munger watching his Q&A's at the Berkshire meeting listening to his speeches reading books reading people who are influenced by him and it doesn't change my behavior I'm just wasting time. And so the main theme the thing that jumped out the most was Charlie has an almost complete indifference to problems. His perspective if I could summarize it would be like hey troubles from time to time should be expected. They're an inescapable part of life so why let it bother you? Just handle them and then move on. And this idea he's talking about in business there's problems that are inescapable and in your personal life. And this idea combines with two other ideas that he talked about at the dinner and he talks about you know in the books and in speech and everything else. In that Charlie looks at nearly everything through the lens of history. And his perspective if I could summarize it was like you're not changing human nature things will just keep repeating forever. And so the fact that this guy has deep historical knowledge right he knows that human nature just repeats over and over again. And the fact that because of that deep historical knowledge he knows that no one's getting through life without problems. So then that leads to the summation and what's going to change hopefully changes the behavior which is actually the learning part right. Well it's like okay just because problems are inevitable it doesn't mean you want an abundance of them. So his whole thing is like wisdom is prevention which is only three words and it's crazy if you just sit there and think about what that actually means. And his whole point is like listen problems are inescapable but you need to do your best to avoid problems. And the way you do that this is the third idea that ties together is you go for great. It's harder to do but it makes your life easier if you go for great. Great businesses are rare. Great people are rare but they're worth the time to find. Great businesses throw off way less problems than average or poor businesses. It's like great people will cause way less problems in your life than average or low quality people in the podcast. I hope you listen to the whole thing. I hope it seemed good. I was just so excited and on such like a high I don't even know if it made sense. I listened to it back. I'm like okay I think this is good. But you know I was just so influenced by just being able to meet him. You know I'm just incredibly grateful for it. I didn't want to try to hide my excitement you know and the fact that yeah he is my hero I know he's a human being just like you and I but I do admire him and I do think he's the wisest person I've ever come across and I am you know trying to in many ways like pattern my life after him like in my own unique way. On that episode I talk about like a description of you know if you're around like a low quality or average quality human there's this phrase that my wife says in Spanish that it's just perfect and it describes it and it says that person could drown in a cup of water. And so that one thing go for great. Spend the time to find a great business. I already think like this you know took me 30 something years to find my life's work which obviously I think founders is my life's work. I believe it to be my life's work. I think it's a absolutely great business. It's something I'm obsessed with. And so now taking Charlie's advice I know that the likelihood is that I'm not going to be my business isn't going to go away because the competition my business is going to go away because humans can't handle success. And so they always say it's like another line that Charlie says is fantastic. He's like it's not that getting it's not getting rich that you have to worry about staying sane. Most people never find a great business right. Then once they get into a great business they get bored or their attention span dwindles whatever case is and then they just screw it up by jumping around. And that's why a lot of Charlie's theme is like patience patience patience. He said something in the dinner that was fantastic. I wish I could have wrote it down but he said that like the advantage that him and Warren have you know they repeat this like it's temperament. And he used an adjective I couldn't remember what it was but he's like we just part of our success is we had this this unusual combination of extreme patience extreme patience and like ferocious aggressiveness when they find like a good business because they're just sitting sitting sitting waiting for something they find it and they act incredibly fast. So I just want to tie this up before I go on to other because I can go off and a bunch of tangents on there on here but this idea it's like okay go for great. It'll make your life easier if you go for rage just find great business and you know maybe that's one great business maybe it's two. It's certainly not 50 and I really think you just need one. So find a great business and then surround yourself with great people. And if you do that you're still going to have problems in life. You'll just have a lot less and then you'll know what did Charlie say right. I got a little Charlie monger on my shoulder. Oh this is a problem. That's fine. I'm going to handle it. I'm not going to whine about it. I'm going to handle it. I'm going to move on my life because problems are just part of life. If you're truly getting wiser you'll learn how to avoid most of the problems that are underneath that are under your control. So that is the main lesson. Here's a few other ones that we talked about. Do not spend time on regrets. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be learning from your mistakes. It's like everybody's going to make mistakes. Rub your nose in your mistakes so you're making sure that you're not making that mistake again. He talked about the early part of his career when they were just buying quote unquote great values but crappy businesses and he's like you have to learn from that. It's like no these crappy businesses are you're getting them for that price for a reason. It's like just pay a little bit more and get a great business and then just keep that business forever. And so that's part of him saying hey I don't regret that I made these mistakes and getting in these bad investments or getting in these bad businesses. Like they taught me something and then I just moved on. I'm not going to worry about it. And then I also got to ask him I was like well what I love to do and you see this in my podcast hopefully. It's like I spent a ton of time in these books thinking about like their earlier life and not the 90 or 70 or 80 year old version of Charlie but like what was Charlie doing when he was 20? What was he doing when he was 30? What was he doing when he was 41 when he decided hey I'm going to be a full time investor. I'm not going to practice law anymore. And I was talking to him about that. I was like man I'm like reading about you at this young age and you kind of see they're stumbling onto their ideas. They're kind of trying to figure them out and they're getting closer and closer to like what Berkshire is going to be and at that time Berkshire didn't even exist. And I was just like looking back at this now you know at your age like are you surprised how successful because I'm thinking about the young Charlie Munger the young Warren Buffett. Are you surprised how successful that you and Warren turned out to be? And he goes how could you not be? And then that led to this tangent because you could tee Charlie up with a question but Charlie's going to talk about whatever Charlie wants to talk about and he should because the amount of information that's in this guy's brain and the entire night he just told story after story after story of this amazing business they bought or this amazing deal or this went bad or oh I thought this was right and his recall was absolutely incredible. And this went on a tangent he's like actually I think that me and Warren get too much credit that was interesting and he was talking about the fact that he finds it really odd to be so wealthy and so loved and his point is like that's not a normal human reaction like there is this egalitarianism in human nature that you know people just in general like you have any level of success especially on his level right multi multi billions of dollars of wealth produced for himself and his family like that's not usually you know people can react most people react poorly to that and what I thought about this after I was like you know what I wonder if it's because he spent him and Warren spent so much time teaching other people like if you think about what poor Charlie's almanac is what the questions that he takes at the Berkshire meeting is are what the share Warren Buffett shareholder letters are like those are their lessons like they're all they're doing is saying hey we learned all the stuff and this is what we learned let's take time into writing out the lessons in this form of shareholders and then sharing the lessons that we learned through answering the questions at the meeting and in in aggregate you know you have what is that four or five decades I think it's like 50 or 60 years they've been doing this fit they say let's just say half a century a half a century of documented lessons and then they turn it out and they just make it available for free for everybody else and so how many entrepreneurs investors executives people interested in business have been educated by Warren and Charlie over their lifetimes millions that's not an understatement millions of people and this is certainly the way I feel like I don't look at I don't do this anyways because I it's remarkable how many smart and successful people I meet that are still like caught up in envy that are worried about like this is crazy to me and it's something I learned from Charlie he's like the world isn't run by greed it's run by envy and like you just have to have a good life you have to cure yourself of envy like somebody else is getting richer than you who gives a shit that is always going to happen that has nothing to do with you why does it bother you and I think that's how most people view Warren and Charlie like yeah these guys are super rich way more successful but like look at all the information they put out there that's valuable look at all the information that could change your life so that's my own personal opinion like I didn't get a chance to ask him I didn't even have that thought at the time I just thought about that when I was writing these notes I was like oh that is kind of like why why is that so different you know there's no there's nobody outside of Warren Buffett's or Charlie Munger's house you know protesting or like with a guillotine or all those crazy things that people do when you you get to like the top of like the world's richest people list you know there is like an interesting like why is that the case like why are they the exception so my guess is again they spent a ton of time teaching others another thing ask the question like what role did like your parents play and like your driver success like were you trying to like show mom and dad like hey this is what I could do and you know Charlie's like no he's like I always had an inner clock I just do what I want to do and I don't care about the ideas or thoughts of other people and as a result this inner clock he talks about like deals like they turned down they could make they get all kinds of crazy deal flow from their positions as you can imagine I think the teaching aspect of that is a huge part of it and yet they have opportunity to make like a bunch of money risk-free and it's like a business that you know may harm other people or they just didn't like it and they would turn it down so that's this whole like inner clock things like I'm just gonna do what I want to do and that was a larger theme too where Charlie's not his whole thing is like he likes people that like one of his favorite entrepreneurs is Jim Sinegal from Costco I got asked was like why can't I find any information on Jim he doesn't give speeches there's no books it's like cuz he's busy working I thought that was hilarious but um he just like if you think about he's like well just go out and build a business that helps other people like what is the whole business model of Costco is like they use their size to get unbelievably deals unbelievable deals for their customers and then instead of like marking up more than they could they just pass that savings on to their millions of millions of customers and I think I read in the tower Charlie Munger they have like a hundred and fifty million checkouts a year that that information's you know maybe a decade old so it's probably more now so what is the aggregate goodwill of like just amount of savings that this idea that Jim had and that he grew over multiple decades like what is the benefit to his customers and to society at large like it's large like you're saving a ton of money because of this unique business that Jim built and I think that's what Charlie would give you advice to do is just like do something that other people value and then do it for a long time and really really really give a shit about the business that you like you can tell his whole thing is like hey you're gonna you're gonna have more success another like hack of his and I hate using the word another like good idea of his maybe that's the better way is just like if if you just move yourself into a business that we have an intense interest that's gonna cure most of your problems like you're just gonna think about all time you're gonna constantly improve it you're not gonna quit and that right there is probably you know 80 to 90 percent of it and then something else that was lucky about is the fact that the night started in So he was sitting there were in a small group and he is back is to like behind him is all his book shelves and I was just scanning his bookshelves as he was talking and I noticed a bunch of books that I had read so I was able to like bring up these obscure books like I brought up the fact that I saw Henry Kaiser's biography on the shelves and I read that book like four years ago it was episode 66 of founders and so then Charlie just goes into I just bring up Kaiser and like what he thought about him and like his recall was just unbelievable you know he hadn't read that book in a long time winds up knowing Henry Kaiser's partner could tell you about the the businesses that Henry built I can tell you about the role that he played in World War two building the Liberty ships we talked about the fact that Kaiser bought was one of the people that built helped build the Hoover Dam and so this this kind of thing just happened you just mentioned one person he could talk about it forever and that really made me realize it's like okay anybody at 99 years old is gonna have some kind of cognitive decline but imagine like just how powerful his guy's mind was when he was younger and like that's he did a lot of work to do that you know he's read thousands and thousands of book books spent thousands and thousands not even tens of thousands I don't know a hundred thousand hours deep in thought thinking about the stuff he's learning thinking about the things that are going on in the world thinking about what he wanted like how the business that he wants to build and so that knowledge firsthand he's always talked about how knowledge compounds like be a learning machine go you know he says go to sleep every night a little smarter than you were and if you know over a long period of time it really makes a difference like you see that in his conversations like oh this guy lives his ideas he's not just out there BSing people he's like this is just I'm just telling the ideas that I used in my life and if it was valuable for me it's probably valuable for other people like I just think that's it's part of his wisdom is just how simple it is and what would Charlie be telling you is like okay well if it's simple advice like why are more people using it since like it's in human nature to over complicate things and so that's his whole point is like why he repeats things over and over again because like you just have to keep it as simple as possible because you're likely just by like your natural tendency is going to over complicate your life and then of course one of the questions I had to ask him was I wanted to talk to him about Ben Franklin because Ben Franklin was his hero Charlie makes like these busts of uh people he admires and two of the people he has busts of are Ben Franklin and Lee Kuan Yew calls Lee Kuan Yew like the Warren Buffett of Singapore but when we're talking about Ben Franklin I brought up this book that covered I think it was episode 251 is Franklin and Washington about their their partnership they had and he didn't he hadn't read the book yet but he knew all about like Franklin's relationship with Washington and so what he was talking to us a lot about like you know he believes it's unlikely to ever have another life as remarkable as Ben Franklin that he was number one in business number one in science number one in politics all like at the same time in one life form his our lifetime is just like that's never we're never gonna see that again and he just thinks he's just absolutely wise and remarkable and if you read Ben Franklin you realize that what Charlie did is just take a lot of Franklin's ideas and then update them and reword them but a lot of it's they think very similarly uh and the way they communicate uh it's very it's it's very similar as well but what I thought was interesting is the important part that jumped out of him is the fact that Ben Franklin did something very smart he says Ben Franklin did something very smart his whole life was that he sought out other impressive people like George Washington he did this when he was young he did this when he was old he did it his entire life and then Charlie went in he says Andrew Carnegie did this too and then I got to ask him a follow-up question I was like well is is this something that you did in your life and immediately he says absolutely and still do and he was pointing out it's like you find go for great goes back to that main idea right go for great find other first of all build yourself up into an impressive impressive formidable person that takes a lot of work right but once you do that you find other people that are like you and then you build relationships with them and they made in many cases they had friendships and business relationships with the same people that they met in their youth their entire lives a lot of them have you know passed away since then but it was something very important and Charlie still does this where he seeks out other you know young interesting smart people whatever the case is every single person at this dinner with me it was only I think five of us I there were all 50 years 60 years younger than Charlie and he was also talking about like if he doesn't see people in person like he'll he'll seek out and he'll talk to other smart people on zoom you know he's still doing this at 99 he's still curious he's still reading still paying attention to what's going on in business is he's like never gonna stop he's like the only way this is gonna stop is when he dies another thing goes back to like just building your business around the set of simple ideas they have that notoriety that like cult like following because of the they're just constant teaching constant sharing everything they learn you know a lot of people call them first they see a lot of deals first and so they combine that idea with the fact that they made so much money because they had they always had a ton of cash and they could move fast and he would tell deals you know crazy examples where like somebody calls him like a saturday and they're like hey this business is like having a bunch of trouble there's maybe one subsidiary that Charlie and Warren knew about in advance because they're like they know what's going on they know what they're interested in they're just waiting for the opportunity to get it and in one case they're like hey if you want this we need 450 million dollars and this is like on a saturday morning or something and we need it by monday and it was interesting because the lawyers are telling Warren and Charlie no we can't do this like we don't have a contract yet we have to go through it we should inspect it and because of their relationships because of the fact that they know in their mind like what assets they want and Charlie said like Warren and Charlie ignored the lawyers they're like no we think this is a good deal Warren wired the money first thing monday morning without even an email no contract no email just on the strength of the relationship with a person calling them and the fact that they knew the the actual value of the asset that they were buying and Charlie said something like they made a couple billion dollars on that deal risk-free and so that's just like one example of a bunch of he just walked us through like the way they thought about things and again it's like yes if you look at Berkshire today unbelievably complicated you can't imagine like how the hell this thing came to to exist but if you look at it from their perspective it was like okay we started out doing one thing I mean like 40 he's like 41 I think Warren let's say he's mid-40s Warren's like late 30s you know as they're like trying to figure this out and then they just keep building on it keep learning from it and over time that's when you get it's like super complicated but from their perspective it's like oh it's like simple because we were learning as we went and then we had an idea it's like oh we made a wrong mistake here okay we'll just course correct real quick and then we'll keep we won't do that next time and then we'll just keep building and building and building this goes back to like I really do believe in something that's so important time is just going to carry most of the way time is going to do most of the work the hard part for you and I is like finding a truly great business with truly great people around us and just staying there and not all of the advice that he was giving us was was business advice like something's interesting few people they were parents he says he's like listen I didn't try to steer my kids or my grandkids into what they should do for a living this is very similar and this is like also being self-aware it's like Charlie knows he's rare like he's very aware that he is rare like the idea that you're gonna have somebody like him like you're just gonna keep birthing you know I think he's got like 10 kids like 30 something grandkids who knows how many this is unlikely like he's a one in a 10 million kind of person and so he's like listen one he thought it was it was beneficial that he got rich he got wealthy later in life but if you ask him like this is something people struggle with you know they're like hey in many cases they you were interested in entrepreneurship you're interested in investing you build a very successful life some of that success is financial and then all of a sudden like your kids are growing up in like comfort that that Charlie didn't grow up in and so like how do you do with that he's like of course of course some of them are going to be less motivated because they were born rich like what there's no solution to that problem and then he talked about like what do you do like you know people struggle with like when they're wealthy it's like what are you doing like you're gonna give that money to your kids and his advice was the most unique because this is something that appears over and over again in these biographies that I read and no one has the answer everybody's like I don't know I don't know what to do like sometimes it turns out well sometimes it turns out bad and his whole point he goes you have to give them the money or they're gonna hate you for it and his whole point is it's like you wanted you had kids you wanted to build a good relationship with them you've tried to lead by example that's all you can do and what's the point of like building wealth and then saying sorry kids like I'm giving this all away and then having it's he's like it's just in human nature his whole thing let's go back to what do you what's at the very top of my list he's like he looks at everything through the lens of history you aren't changing human nature things will just keep repeating forever are you learning from that are you learning from history or not and in charlie's case he's obviously learning from history he's like oh you know they're just gonna hate you for it so I think when his wife died he said something like his wife died I think 10 or 12 years ago and they had given away I think they gave away of half their fortune to like their kids and grandkids you know and that's dispersed through like a big amount of a large amount of people but it's still a lot of money and you know he thought that that's what you should do he's like there's no point in doing all this and then having getting to end your life you're having a bad relationship with your kids or having your kids resent you he's like that's that just doesn't make any sense and so yeah of course in some cases they're gonna be less motivated because they're born rich that too is also human nature and then I had a selfish question I got to ask him I was like Charlie like why didn't you write an autobiography like what come on man that would be fantastic and he says to answer his question he said his answer was very simple he's like well it's too hard to do correctly and I didn't want to do it and there's also enough enough people out there like categorizing and summarizing and organizing his thoughts I thought it's funny it's like one of my personal goals is like okay live a life so remarkable that somebody writes a book about it and then you can have that book on your shelf before you die so I found there's a few books about him on his shelf one of them I haven't done for the podcast and it's shame on me it's called seeking wisdom from Darwin to Munger I think um so I'll do that soon uh maybe I'll like maybe like a month or two um I don't want to keep doing just not all Charlie Munger episodes but I'll definitely do that episode um and I don't think I want to wait too long because I want like the this is like dinner from him to still be you know in like fresh my mind um so he didn't want to write an autobiography he did talk about that poor Charlie's almanac is being reprinted and there's going to be an online version soon through striped press and I think that's coming later on this year which is fantastic because I have the physical book but I would love to be able to search that book and to have a kindle version would be excellent Charlie is who he says he is like he loves a good deal he talked about like look at this shirt I bought you know it's $12 I've had it forever look at this watch you can't get it cheaper uh he lived in a modest house it was it was a don't get me wrong it's a nice house but there's no way that you think that a multi-billionaire lives in that house and so that goes back to you know he is who he says he is he's just like listen I like to read I like to make money with my mind I like to talk to interesting smart people I like to think about the world and he's like he built a world around that he just happened to be unbelievably good at that to the point where like you know his brain can essentially produce an unlimited amount of money and that leads me to the last thing that I wrote down and I think it applies not he's going to say this for investing but it applies to building a business like if done done at the highest levels entrepreneurship investing at the highest levels they produce the most material they produce the most wealth in the world that should tell you right from outside at least it's not easy it's supposed to be hard it's going to be hard it fights against your nature every bone of your body every all of your nature because most of these businesses like all the what Peter Tio says in zero to one it's like the problem with the technology industry now is that they optimize for growth at the expense of durability and that doesn't make any sense because all the value of a company is coming 10 20 30 years into the future and everybody quits before they collect the value Charlie and Warren just said okay well this is going to compound we'll just ride this thing for the rest of our lives which again is obviously the smart thing and go for grape and so the last thing you said was being good at investing is a very rare skill it is not distributed widely and it will never be and so when I think of entrepreneurship it's not an art or a science it's a practice and so when I'm hearing Charlie say that to me it's like being good being a good founder is a very rare skill it is not distributed widely and it will never be and so what I'm doing with that information is I'm going to keep up my practice for as long as possible I'm going to use the less sense from history's greatest entrepreneurs as leverage and then I'll let time carry most of the weight and at the end of that I will be in possession of a very rare skill and that is where I left it I just have one ask or one suggestion for you one of my favorite things that Charlie ever said he said at the Berkshire meeting Berkshire annual meeting back in 2010 and he said that the best thing that a human being can do is help another human being know more and so the one suggestion I have for you is I'm going to leave a link in the show notes in the last few years of his life Charlie was working hand in hand with stripe and stripe press to republish a new version of poor Charlize Aminak there's going to be a digital version for the first time there is a several hour interview that Charlie recorded with John Collison one of the co-founders of stripe I already have an advanced copy in fact I have two advanced copies of the stripe press version of poor Charlize Aminak it's incredibly well made the book is actually released next week it is a great collection of the knowledge that Charlie Munger accumulated over his lifetime and that he wanted to share with other people so I will leave that link down below I highly recommend pre-ordering the book and buying copies for yourself and for your loved ones I will also leave a list of all the Charlie Munger episodes that I've made so far I would start with episode 295 which I referenced in this it's called I had dinner with Charlie Munger episode 286 it's titled Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger it's based on the book all I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there Buffett and Munger a study in simplicity and uncommon common sense then episode 221 is on Charlie Munger's biography titled damn right episode 90 is the first time I ever did an episode on poor Charlie's Aminak the original version I'm rereading poor Charlie's Aminak now the stripe press version and eventually we'll do an episode on that in next week or two that's episode 90 episode 79 is on the book the complete investor which is about Charlie Munger and finally episode 78 which is the first time I made an episode on this fantastic little book called the Tao of Charlie Munger that list of episodes will also be in the show notes as well I highly recommend starting with episode 295 if you have not listened to it yet thanks for listening and I'll talk to you again soon
