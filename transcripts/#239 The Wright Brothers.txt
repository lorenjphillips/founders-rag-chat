--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At exactly 1035, Orville slipped the rope restraining the flyer and headed forward. At the end of the track, the flyer lifted into the air and Daniels, who had never operated a camera until then, snapped the shutter to take what would become one of the most historic photographs of the century. The course of the flight, in Orville's words, was extremely erratic. The flyer rose, dipped down, rose again, bounced, and dipped again like a bucking bronco. The distance flown had been 120 feet. The total time airborne was approximately 12 seconds. Were you scared, Orville would be asked? Scared, he said with a smile. There wasn't time. It was only a flight of 12 seconds, he said, and it was an uncertain, wavy, creeping sort of flight at best, but it was a real flight at last. Wilbur took a turn and went off like a bird for 175 feet. Orville went again, flying 200 feet. Then on the fourth test, Wilbur flew through the air and a distance of 852 feet over the ground in 59 seconds. It had taken four years. They had endured violent storms, accidents, one disappointment after another, public indifference and ridicule, and clouds of demon mosquitoes. To get to and from their remote sand dune testing ground, they had made five round trips from Ohio, a total of 7,000 miles by train, all to fly a little more than half a mile. No matter, they had done it. Success it most certainly was, and more. What had transpired that day in 1903 in the stiff winds and cold of the Outer Banks in less than two hours time was one of the turning points in history. The beginning of change for the world far greater than any of those present could possibly have imagined. Being the kind of men they were, neither ever said the stunning contrast between their success and Samuel Langley's full-scale failure just days before. Langley's project had cost nearly $70,000, the greater part of it public money. Whereas the Wright Brothers total expenses for everything from 1900 to 1903, including the materials and travel to and from Kitty Hawk, came to a little less than $1,000, a sum paid entirely from the modest profits of their bicycle business. Of those who had been eyewitnesses, John T. Daniels was the most effusive about what he had felt. I like to think about that first airplane, he said, the way it sailed off in the air, as pretty as any bird you ever laid your eyes on, and I don't think I ever saw a prettier sight in my life. But it would have never happened, Daniel stressed, had it not been for the two workingest boys he ever met. It wasn't luck that made them fly, it was hard work and common sense. They put their whole heart and soul and all of their energy into an idea and they had faith. That is an excerpt from the book that I just reread and the one I'm going to talk to you about today, which is The Wright Brothers and it was written by David McCullough. I read this book for the first time four years ago and I actually did a podcast that's founders number 28 on it and I wanted to reread it because I think it's the single best illustration of this idea that I learned from Paul Graham. Paul Graham is a prolific writer, he's also the founder of Y Combinator and his website's just fantastic because he's got all these great essays and he wrote an essay back in 2009 and I just want to read the first paragraph and the last paragraph. I'll also leave it in the show notes in case you haven't read it, it's fantastic and Paul has seen a ton of startup founders through his mentorship and his investment so I think that adds some weight onto his opinion, onto his words, what he's about to say here and he says, a couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words, relentlessly resourceful. So that's the first paragraph, this is the last paragraph. You can even use it tactically. If I were running a startup this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror, make something people want is the destination but be relentlessly resourceful is how you get there and that excerpt I just read to you is a great example of that. The Wright brothers solved an ancient problem through their own work and research for less than a thousand dollars and they couldn't have done that unless they were relentlessly resourceful. And two quick things before I jump back into the book, if you want to buy a gift description for somebody else that link is down below in the show notes on your podcast player, it is also available at founderspodcast.com. In the early days of Amazon Jeff Bezos talked about the importance of having a shared base of knowledge with your co-workers and so Jeff and all the early executives at Amazon would actually read the same books. And so companies are also doing that with founders, they're buying gift descriptions to founders for the founding team and the executives. And that's one use case that I'm seeing pop up over and over again so I just want to bring it to your attention in case you wanted to do that at your company as well. And the second thing real quick is a combination of an idea from Charlie Munger and Mark Andreessen. Charlie Munger has this quote in the book Damn Right, which I covered back on founders number 221 and he says, everybody engaged in complicated work needs colleagues. Just the discipline of having to put your thoughts in order with somebody else is a very useful thing. And then Mark Andreessen talks about the fact that he's read hundreds of biographies and he says what that allows him to do is to build little mental models and to stress test his own ideas. So when he's presented with a decision, he'll say, okay, what would Elon Musk do in this situation? What would Henry Ford do in the situation? What would Steve Jobs do in the situation? And I think a combination of those two ideas is very common thought that most founders have. And I know this because a lot of founders get in touch with me and ask, hey, is there a way I can talk to you to kind of balance this idea that I'm dealing with in my business off of what you have, what you've learned about the history of entrepreneurship? And so I get more of these requests than I have time to accommodate. And so I decided to make it a service if you're interested in organizing your thoughts or if you want to stress test your ideas against what I've learned, there's a link down below. Same thing. It's in everything. All the links that I mentioned are in the show notes in your pockets player. They're also available at founderspodcast.com. Okay, so let me get back into the book. The book starts with a fantastic quote and there's a bunch of great one liners in here, some of which I've never forgotten in the four years since I read it. The very first page it says this is a quote by Wilbur Wright and it says, no bird soars in a calm. So I just want to read two paragraphs from you. They come from the prologue and it says, according to the brothers, Wilbur and Overwright, their fascination with flight began with them with a toy. It was a small helicopter that was brought home by their father, Bishop Wright. Their father was a great believer in the educational value of toys. And so the two most important characters in the book are obviously Wilbur and Overwright. I would say their father, and I'm going to speak a lot more about him today. Their father is the next most important character in the story. He's somebody I greatly admire and you'll see why. It says Orville, now this is the second paragraph. This is crazy. Orville's first grade teacher would remember him at his desk tinkering with bits of wood. Asked what he was up to, he told her he was making a machine of a kind that he and his brother were going to fly someday. Okay, so I want to get in the first chapter. I want to talk about their personality traits. I just reread a bunch of my highlights. Obviously I'm going to talk about both Wright brothers today. The one I admire the most, the one that I kept writing on the notes and in the margins of person that I want to copy a trait, like they have trait, he had a trait that I want or I want to emulate is Wilbur. So a lot of my and he's kind of like the leader of the two Wright brothers, although they're both very, very important, but you're going to hear me talk about him a lot today. First, they talk about this photograph where it shows the entire Wright, the entire family, their brothers, their sister, their dad, and it says, but what was most uncharacteristic about the picture is that they, meaning Orville and Wilbur, sit doing nothing, something they almost never succumbed to. They were brothers and partners in every single sense of the word. And you'll see that here, they lived in the same house, they worked together six days a week, they ate their meals together, they kept their money in a joint bank account. They even thought together and that quote, they even thought together something that Wilbur said about him and his brother. The brothers had tremendous energy. So again, going right into if you saw the margins in this book, also something I did whenever I reread a book, sometimes I buy a new copy. Sometimes I reread the copy that I previously highlighted and annotated. I don't have a rhyme or reason to this, but for this thing, for this this time around, I just decided to buy a fresh paper book copy. And so that's what I'm working off of. And if you could see the paperback that I have in my hand, like in the margins over and over again, it's like I want this trait, I want to be that way over and over again. And it says the brothers had tremendous energy working hard every day, but Sunday was a way of life. Hard work was a conviction. And they were at their best and happiest working together on their own projects. And then it's going to get into how they worked. This is the first mention of something that's repeated over and over again. And something we've seen with Jeff Bezos, with Steve Jobs, Edwin Land, there is Ed Catmull, even the founder of Pixar said the same thing, there is a benefit to the conflict. Internal conflict can actually produce better results than just seeking internal harmony. And I'll go into more detail later on. But this is the first example that not that things always went smoothly. They could be highly demanding and critical of each other. They could disagree to the point of shouting. At times after an hour or more of heated argument, they would find themselves as far from agreement as when they started. Now this is crazy, except that each had changed to the other's original position. And there's examples of the book of that they'll have a big argument overnight. The next morning they come in and usually they have they're working with other people like this guy Charlie Taylor who helped them with the engines of the first airplane. They'd walk in and say and Wilbur would say, you know what, I've been thinking about it. Orville's right. Let's do it his way. A few minutes later, Orville would walk in like, you know, I was thinking about it. Wilbur's right. Let's do it his way. So that example is like they'd start off in opposition and completely switch. And then this is just fantastic. I double underline this sentence. Neither ever chose to be anything other than himself. In a number of ways, they were unidentical twins. Orville moved at a more or less normal pace. Wilbur was tremendously active of movement, of movement, walking always with a long rapid stride. Wilbur was more serious by nature, more studious and more reflective. His memory of what he had seen and heard and so much of what he had read was astonishing. Such were Wilbur's powers of concentration that to some he seemed a little strange. He definitely lived inside of his own head. This example of that, the strongest impression one gets of Wilbur Wright said an old schoolmate is of a man who lives largely in a world of his own. Wilbur also had an unusual presence and remained imperturbable under almost any circumstance. Never rattled, his father was proud to say. He was an exceptional public speaker and lucid writer, which seemed out of context for someone often so silent. His remarks were articulate, to the point and quite often memorable. And these just positive personality continues on the next page. Wilbur was little bothered by what others might be thinking or saying. They were always perfect gentlemen, naturally courteous to all. They never drank hard liquor nor smoked or gambled. What the two had in common above all was a unity of purpose and unyielding determination. They had set themselves on a mission. And then we get to the father, their father, Bishop Wright, who I mentioned earlier. And the Norlach himself is the Wright brothers were blessed with a great, great father. It's almost like if you had like a Charlie Munger or like a Benjamin Franklin as your dad, and he would just pepper you with little maxims and guides for life. He does this throughout the book and a lot of things he says are pretty memorable. So much so that they quote him for years, or at least Orville quotes him for years after he dies because unfortunately Bishop Wright outlives Wilbur. Wilbur dies of typhoid fever rather young at 45 years old. So it says, from wide reading and observations of life, he, meaning Bishop Wright, the dad, had acquired what seemed an inexhaustible supply of advice on behavior, habits, good and bad habits, things to beware of in life, and goals to strive for. At home he preached courage and good character, finding a worthy purpose and perseverance. So these are all things that they listened to lessons and they kind of ran with it. Providing guidelines he understood to be part of a father's duty. And then he says, make business first, pleasure afterward, and that guarded. All the money anyone needs is just enough to prevent one from being a burden on others. And he also set a fantastic example for the entire family because the entire family, everybody, read all the time a lot of the motivations to become obsessed with solving this the problem of powered flight comes from a lot of the books they were reading. So it says, the brothers were well into their 20s before there was running water or plumbing in the house. So they had to go, there was an outhouse out back. That's where they'd go to the bathroom and there was no electricity. The Wright family book collection, however, so it's talking about like they grew up in really like a modest, in modest circumstances. The father did not have a lot of money but the little money he did have he would spend on books. And he says, the Wright family book collection, however, was neither modest nor commonplace. Bishop Wright, a lifelong lover of books, heartily championed the limitless value of reading. That is a fantastic way to put reading. It is of limitless value. Between formal education at school and informal education at home, it would seem that he would put that he put more value on the latter. He was never overly concerned about his children's attendance at school. If one or the other of them thought, chose to miss a day or two for some project or interest he thought worthy, it was all right by him. And certainly, he ranked reading as worthy. Everyone in the house read all the time. Wilbur read just about everything but he had a particular love of history. And then the father would quote some lines from books, lines that stuck out as like little maxims for to guide them throughout life, which is absolutely fantastic. It's kind of similar to what you and I are doing with these books, right? And so they're quoting from a book and says, every mind should be this is such great think about, let me read it to you. No, you know, let me think about a father telling his children this and unfortunately, their mother dies rather young. I forgot what kind of some kind of disease. I don't think it was type four fever. I can't remember exactly. So it says every mind should be true to itself, should think in investigate and conclude for itself. That is a line that becomes extremely important because it's not like the Wright brothers were the only people attempting to solve this problem. The book, David McCullough, the author of this book does a fantastic job of just kind of summarizing, you know, this is a problem that that humans had fantasized about for thousands of years that it attempted to solve for thousands of years. And so let me read that that line again, every mind should be true to itself, it should think investigate and conclude for itself. What you and I would refer to as like shorthand is like, we need to be capable of independent thinking, something that obviously comes up a lot in these stories that you and I go over. And so the no, I left myself on that previous page was they were blessed with a great father. They also knew that they were blessed with a great father. And it says years later, a friend told overall that he and his brother would always stand in this as an example of how far Americans with no special advantages could advance in the world. So what they're talking about is the fact that they didn't have a lot of money. But almost like we had had non monetary benefits. But this isn't true. Orville responded emphatically to say that we had no special advantages. The greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity. The encouragement to be independent to be independent thinkers and then to also that you can go out and you can do things for yourself. They put this to practice really early. They're resourceful and industrious from a very early age. They start their own print shop. So this is in there. Well, let me just read to you while they're still in high school. Orville started his own print shop in the carriage shed behind the house. This is crazy. Listen to this sentence. He designed and built his own printing press using a discarded tombstone, a buggy spring and scrap metal. With the help of Wilbur, he began publishing a newspaper called the West Side News, which is devoted to the going to the going ons and interest of their part of Dayton, Ohio. So they make a little money from selling ads. They were just talking about the news in their little town. It says now and then the brothers would include items from other publications that they judged worthy of their readers attention. And so this is a quote. They read this. They liked it. So they put it in. There's two paragraphs they wanted the readers to know. Do not wait for the boy to grow up before you begin to treat him as an equal. A proper amount of confidence and words of encouragement and advice. This sounds like exactly what their father did to them. Give him to understand that you trust him in many ways. It helps to make a man of him long before he is a man in either stature or years. If a boy finds he can find a few articles with his hands, if a boy finds he can make a few articles with his hands. And so I have this is they're writing this around the late 1800s, early 1900s. Claude Hopkins. I did the podcast on him that probably history's greatest copywriter. I think it was like founders number 170. He uses that word that word articles to it's not what you and I think of articles is not written. It's somewhat like really you can substitute for like products making something. So if a boy can find he can make a few products with his hands, it tends to make him rely on himself and the planning that is necessary for the execution of the work is a discipline and an education of great value to him. So that sounds exactly what essentially they're giving advice to reprinting advice. It sounds what their father did for them. With the paper showing some profit Orville moved the business to a rented space and Wilbur who is now 22 was prominently listed as the editor. So that was their first business. Their second business is going to come from the fact that at this point in history the bicycle was taking over. It was an absolute phenomenon and it spread like wildfire. So it says bicycles had become the sensation of the time. It was a craze everywhere. You can kind of think about this as like the internet in our day. The bicycle was proclaimed to be a boon to all mankind. A thing of beauty. Good for the spirits. Good for health and vitality and indeed one's whole outlook on life. And it just goes into more details just how it went from essentially zero to a hundred in no time. And so the Wright brothers spotted an opportunity like okay we're going to we can manufacture like they can build anything. They're extremely resourceful. It says in the spring of 1893 Wilbur and Orville opened their own small bicycle business. The Wright Cycle Exchange they called it and they started selling and repairing bicycles. And I'm not sure why but now obviously I've read what 230 books since the last time I read this book. And there's something about that paragraph that made me think of what Bill Gates said. Back on founders number 174 I read this book called Overdrive. It's the sequel to that Bill Gates biography called Hard Drive. And in Overdrive it talks about how Bill Gates kind of missed the internet. And so I just want to read one paragraph from that book Overdrive. It says finally the internet had the attention of the man in charge of the biggest and most powerful software company on the planet. But that was just about all. Microsoft still had not started to develop a business and technical strategy for responding to this phenomenon. It would be more than a year before Gates fully acknowledged the importance of the internet and decreed all of Microsoft's considerable brain and firepower be directed at the most serious challenge the company had ever faced. So he was slow to the realization but once he realized it he put all the force and essentially turned Microsoft on a dime. He says something in that book later on though that really is the main point of why I read that is that you can never fight against a phenomenon as powerful as something like the bicycle craze in the rights day or the internet in our day. That you have to you don't fight against it. That you should use it to your benefit. So they open up their business they start doing well but that attracts a lot of attention. A lot of other people start building bicycle shops so they have a lot more competition that's going to draw down lower their profits obviously. And this is where we see that Wilbur has this tendency in his life to kind of take a pause and be like hey I'm not actually sure I'm on the right track here. And it says business remained good but with the opening of more bicycle shops in town competition kept growing. When sales grew slack Wilbur turned conspicuously restless. Uncertain of what to make of his life. He had long thought he'd like to be a teacher which he which he thought was an honorable pursuit. He had no knack for business he decided. Now this is hilarious that he says this. Remember this later on because they also reference this after they've invented and they're starting to sell airplanes. He's actually having to learn how to be an entrepreneur at the highest levels on the fly and they reference this what he's about to say here. How he he previously doubted that he could actually even like he's not he's like I don't have any business skills. Turns out he does he just didn't know so that he didn't know he had those skills. He had no knack for business he decided he felt ill-suited for it. Now he says I do not think I am fitted for success in any commercial pursuit. I might make a living but I doubt whether I would ever do much more than that. And so he writes this long letter and just basically putting down his thoughts on what it would take to be successful in business. In business it is the aggressive man who continually has his eye on his own interest who succeeds. No man has ever been successful in business who is not aggressive, self-assertive, and even a little bit selfish perhaps. There's nothing reprehensible in an aggressive disposition so long as it is not carried to excess. For such men make the world and its affairs move. We have all done we have done reasonably well. Better in fact than the average man perhaps but not one of us has yet made particular use of the talent in which he excels other men. That is why our success has only been moderate. So that's actually really wise that he actually put this. It's like we've done better than average but we haven't lived up to our full potential full capability because we haven't picked a market we haven't picked a product we haven't picked an endeavor which actually makes use of our particular talent. The talent that we possess greater than every other person. He's not doing that in the bicycle business. They do do that in the airplane business or the creation of the airplane business is another way to think about it. So this this went on for a little bit but then it says then sales that the company picked up again to the point where they were selling about 150 bicycles a year and Wilbur stayed with it. Okay so while they're running their bicycle business Orville is 25 years old he gets sick with typhoid fever and this was extremely deadly at this point they were worried he was going to die so he's very close to death so they're trying the entire family is trying to like nurse him back to health and this is when they start reading in earnest about all the other work that has preceded them because they want to they want to build on the work of the great people that came before them right and so he's going to write Wilbur is going to write this one of the most famous letters in history it's to the Smithsonian Institute requesting all the materials they have on powered flight and this happens in the year 1899 so i'm going to read this to you i want to read one quote before i get to that letter that Wilbur writes in that letter and one thing is for sure if Wilbur Wright was alive today he would definitely subscribe to founders he says i wish to avail myself of all that is already known i wish to avail myself of all that is already known so please send me the information that i need for what these people accomplished before i was even alive i'm going to read everything and i'm going to build on where they left off it says during this time Wilbur had begun reading about the german glider enthusiast Otto Lilienthal who had recently been killed in an accident much that he read he read aloud to Orville so he's reading to his brother while his brother is trying to recuperate from typhoid fever and so you could think about this guy Otto as like their blueprint the first version of their blueprint a man auto was a manufacturer of small steam engines and a mining engineer by training Lilienthal had started gliding as early as 1869 and from the start so 30 years before they're reading about him and from the start he had been joined in his aviation experiments by his younger brother he took his lessons from the birds Otto said what we are seeking he's talking about the the problem that he's trying to solve and he's just one person in a long line of human history that's doing that's trying to solve this problem what we are seeking is the means of free motion in the air in any direction over the years Lilienthal had designed and built more than a dozen different gliders Lilienthal would position himself on a steep slope the wings above his head there's some pictures on the internet of this and one picture in the book it just looks wild what this guy's doing he stood like an athlete waiting for the waiting for the starting pistol then he would run down the slope and into the wind this is also how he's gonna die in 1894 Lilienthal had crashed but he lived to tell the tale then two years later he crashed again falling from an altitude of 50 feet he died of a broken spine at the age of 48 and so they're reading his writing and he's essentially from the grave i mean he wrote the words obviously before he died he didn't know what was going to happen to him but he's saying no matter what we have to carry on this work it must and this is Lilienthal writing it must not remain our desire only to acquire the art of the bird it is our duty not to rest until we have attained a perfect scientific conception of the problem of flight and so very interesting when they start when they start building their they call them flyers but like the very primitive the very first airplanes very primitive versions of airplanes Wilbur and Orville make a pact where they're like listen we cannot fly together because we have a very real possibility that one of us is going to die in fact Orville has experienced one of the first plane crashes he falls from 75 feet and survives this passenger winds up dying but basically they're saying hey we can't fly together because we have very real possibility that we may die and if one of us dies the other person has to be alive to continue on the work so when McCullough says like they were engaged in a mission he means that with him in every sense of the word and so this is their surprising reaction to Lilienthal's death news of Lilienthal's death Wilbur later wrote aroused in him as nothing had an interest that had remained passive from childhood he his reading on the flights of birds became intense that's a great word there because this guy goes ham he reads every single book he can possibly find on birds local they call aerial motion i think is the the term i'm going to get to that here uh now aerial locomotion excuse me so it says aerial locomotion has always excited the strongest curiosity among mankind so that is in line from this book he's reading this thing called animal mechanism it was written by a lot of these names i'm going to butcher and mispronounce today for some reason the french had like extensive interest and they probably had the largest collection of like aviation literature before the invention of the airplane than any other country so this book was actually written it's about like the the motion of birds it was written by a french physician i'm not going to try to pronounce the person's name but he says aerial locomotion has always excited the strongest curiosity among mankind so essentially he's saying that the very introduction of the book he's telling us listen this is an ancient unsolved problem and so that is why i think in my opinion this book that i'm holding my hand it should be in every single founder's every single entrepreneur's library it's less than 300 pages it it tells the story of two resourceful brothers with not a lot of money no education no connections going up against the the the best well-funded and famous uh competition you're talking i'll get to that later but like alexander graham bell was going after this problem here in maxim thomas edison the smithsonian institute all of them had 100 200 300 times the resources as the right brothers and they're going after an ancient unsolved problem and the right brothers are the ones that figure out how to do it it's extremely extremely inspiring so now he picks up another book listen to listen to the title animal locomotion are walking swimming and flying with a dissertation of on aeronautics so says for most readers the title alone would have been too daunting for wilbur the book was exactly what he needed this is everything i'm about to read to you is just the example of him being inspired like you cannot put a price on inspiration it's extremely powerful for human beings he's inspired by what he read and so this guy's name is pedigree uh those so pedigree is going to say right here for wilbur this is why so wilbur's reading pedigree's pedigree's words and this is why it was just right at the uh like the perfect timing form and pedigree says those authors who regard artificial flight as impractical remark that the land supports the the quadr- the people that walk on feet and the water the fish this is quite true but it's equally true that the air supports the air supports the bird of all the animal movements flight is indisputably the finest the fact that a creature can by the unaided movements of its own wings urge itself through the air with the speed of a cannonball fills the mind with wonder so this guy is a straight-up evangelist and so that's the way to think about what's happening wilbur has picked up he's having a one-sided conversation i'm pretty sure the guy is long dead his name is j j bell pedigree he is having and when you pick up a book and you're reading somebody's words you're having a one-sided conversation with them he's having a one-sided conversation with his version of the eminent dead to quote charlie monger right and this evangelist from the other side of the grave is firing wilbur full of a passion to go after this very difficult but worthy problem wilbur was drawn upon and and wilbur was to draw upon and quote pedigree for years like the inspiring lectures of a great professor the book had opened his eyes and started him thinking in ways he never had and so this is where wilbur asked for help he says okay i'm going to build on where everybody other people left off i have a couple books in my you know my library that happened to have in ohio i'm sure the spittonian institute has more like i need to to ask them for help wilbur would write one of the most important letters of his life given all that it said in motion it was one of the most important letters in history addressed to the smithsonian institution in washington it filled not quite two sheets i have been interested in the problem of mechanical and human flight ever since a boy my observations since then have only convinced me more firmly that human flight is possible and practical practical excuse me i am about to begin a systematic study of the subject in preparation for practical work to which i expect to devote what time i can spare from my regular business i wish to obtain such papers as the smithsonian institution has published on this subject and if possible a list of other works in print in the english language i am an enthusiast but not a crank in the sense that i have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine so that continues it says he and orville had both began studying in earnest especially helpful were the writings of octave shin i'm i know i'm butchering these people's names by the way but this guy becomes extremely important he's like a generation older than the right brothers and he's been working on this problem for extremely a long time and they wind up becoming friends and collaborators especially helpful were the writings of octave shinute a celebrated french-born american civil engineer builder of bridges and railroads who had made gliders uh who had made gliders uh and then there's this other guy named samuel langley who i also mentioned that's the guy that i mentioned earlier who had spent seventy thousand dollars of public money and was unable to to do what the the right brothers did with just a thousand dollars their modest their profits in their modest business the writings of octave shinu were helpful and so were the writings of samuel langley who was an astronomer and the head of the smithsonian langley was one of the most respected scientists so the reason i'm reading this too is because you think about like no one knew who the right brothers are they're doing all this like this research and all this work in private in their home in their bicycle shop in ohio and they're they're attempting to accomplish the same thing that all these people i'm about to read to you these very formidable people that have way more resources way and access to funding and fame and media and all the things that the right brothers do not so says langley was one of the most respected scientists in the nation his efforts in recent years was were backed by substantial funding it had resulted in him building a strange looking steam-powered aerodrome as he called it it had a look of a monstrous dragonfly and it was launched by catapult and it never it just every time he launched it just fell right into the into the river along with lilinthal shinute and langley numbers uh a number numbers of other among the most prominent engineers scientists and original thinkers of the 19th century had been working on the problem of controlled flight including sir sir george caley sir hero maxim who is the inventor of the machine gun alexander graham bell and thomas edison none had succeeded here maxim had reportedly spent $100,000 of his own money on a giant steam-powered pilotless flying machine only to see it crash while it attempted to take off so that's a hundred grand now maxim spent $70,000 that langley spent uh alexander graham bell set up an entire company for this so like you're talking about and this is in in you know 1800 1900 dollars so millions upon millions upon millions of dollars compared to the thousand dollars that the Wright brothers are going to spend over three years to solve the problem and that leads to what may be my single favorite paragraph in the entire book this is fantastic in no way did any of this discourage or deter wilbur and orville wright any more than the fact that they had no college education no formal technical training no experience working with anyone other than themselves no friends in high places no financial backers no government subsidies and little money of their own are the entirely real possibility that at some point like auto lindlenthal they could be killed so the smithsonian institute sends them a bunch of paper like bunch of research and some books and one of the books is extremely important because uh wilbur finds another evangelist another evangelist for aviation so again he is a he is a missionary zeal applied to this very difficult problem and he's being fired on by the words and the work of the people that came before him this is so important this is why it's so important it's essential to pick the right heroes among the material that smithsonian provided him was an english translation of a book titled i'm going to give you that uh it's in obviously in uh french again it's called the empire of air and it was written by this guy named moulillard uh so this is written by a french farmer poet and student of flight moulillard nothing wilbur had yet read so affected him he would long consider it quote one of the most remarkable pieces of aeronautical literature ever published for wilbur flight had become a cause and moulillard one of the great missionaries of the cause at the start of his empire of air moulillard gave fair warning and this is such this is a perfect sentence because this exactly describes what is happening to the right brothers at this time when once this idea has invaded the brain meaning trying to fly when once this idea has invaded the brain it possesses it exclusively and so they even say so themselves for wilbur and orville the dream had taken hold the works of lillenthal and moulillard the brothers with a test had infected us with their own unquenchable enthusiasm and transformed idle curiosity into the active zeal of workers they would design and build their own experimental glider kite drawing on much what they had read much they had observed about birds in flight and importantly from considerable time thinking and so not only are they reading the work of people like moulillard and some of the people that are still alive like octave chenute they wind up contacting the people that are still alive this is really smart and this is going to remind me something that the advice that steve jobs gave and he says most people never do it i'll get to that in a minute so it says in 1900 wilbur wrote a letter to octave chenute the first letter to the eminent engineer asking for advice on a location where he might conduct flying experiments he needed somewhere where sufficient winds could be counted on there was uh the only such sites he knew of chenute replied were in california and florida but both were deficient in sand hills required for soft landing wilbur might do better he suggested along the coast of south carolina or georgia so wilbur takes that idea he's like okay so he does something smart he's like all right in the answer to that inquiry uh wilbur sent a letter to the united states weather bureau in washington and he asked asking about prevailing winds around the country they then provided the right brothers extensive records of monthly wind velocities at more than 100 weather bureau stations enough for them to take particular interest and a remote spot on the outer banks of north carolina called kitty hawk to be certain kitty hawk was the right choice wilbur wrote again to the head of the weather bureau station there who answered reassuringly about steady winds and sand beaches and i wrote in the um margins after seeing everything they did here this sequence which was really smart i was like these guys are not dummies now what did i mean by asking for help steve j what steve job said i'm gonna quote that i uh took notes on this talk gave i think this talk steve jobs gave i think he was i think this is in between his time of uh in between his two stints at apple when he's still working at next and he says something is fantastic and so this is his exact quote i never found anybody that didn't want to help me if i asked them for help i called a bill hewlett when i was 12 years old he answered the phone himself so that's one of the co-founders of hp obviously i told him i wanted to build a frequency counter i asked him if he had any spare parts i could have he laughed and he gave me the parts and then he gave me a summer job at hp working on the assembly line putting together frequency counters remember he is steve job is 12 i have never found and this is the important part i have never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone i just ask most people never pick up the phone and call and that is what separates the people who do things versus the people who just dream about them you have to act so with this information now they have a location all right we need to build our first prototype this is an example of their resourcefulness the fact that the right brother saved a lot of money because they could do everything themselves the brothers built a full-size glider with two wings that was intended to to reassemble that they intended to reassemble and fly at kitty hawk first as a kite then if all went well they would fly themselves it was it had a wingspan of 18 feet the total cost of all the necessary pieces and parts which include ribs of ash wires cloth to cover the wings was not more than 15 dollars so it's a very difficult trip to get to kitty hawk he says something though when they're at when they when they get to kitty hawk about his intentions and really think about this is like to to thrive the first step of thriving is surviving right he's like will we're stressed that he did not intend to rise many feet from the ground he was there to learn not to take chances for thrills and he says this quote from him the man who wishes to keep at the problem long enough to really learn anything positively must not take risks carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks so kitty hawk at the time it's in the outer banks it's essentially deserted there's not a lot of resources there it's they have to build their own camp like they have to be completely self-sufficient but i want to pull out one paragraph here because it was extremely difficult but they're extremely satisfied it's like they're on this this grand happy adventure in life and it says far from home on their own in a way that they had never been the brothers seemed to sense as they never had the adventure of life orville would later say that even with all the adversities they had to face and the adversity adversities were larger numbers that even with all the adversities they had to face it was the happiest time that they had ever known and so the the locals that live in the area they're they're drawn to like what are these crazy strangers doing out here on the on the beach and you know they obviously thought they were not nuts we couldn't help thinking that they were a pair of poor nuts they'd stand on the beach for hours at a time just looking at the gulls flying soaring and dipping so they're trying to observe and trying to learn flight from observing birds and hopefully some of the observations that that they're noticing from the flight of birds they can use in their own experiments and really this next section was was i just think they have the fit the absolute perfect like frame of mind and let me read it to you and i'll tell you my interpretation it says many nights the wind so they came down for the wind right you need a wind if you're going to build a glider many nights the wind was such that they had to leap from bed to hold their tent down when we crawl out of the tent to fix things the sand blinds us but they could not complain we came down here for wind and sand and we got them and so the interpretation for the purpose for our purposes is you wanted to start a company you knew that it was going to be hard what are you complaining for so on the last podcast i talked about the fact that jay-z had dinner with michael jordan he said something that was interesting having a chance to spend the whole night talking to jordan and he says what he admired most about jordan was his discipline and his commitment to excellence and jay-z said that that that when people have discipline and a commitment to excellence is something he always respects in other people and we see a very similar thought here life on the outer banks was harsh making ends meet was a constant struggle hard workers were greatly admired and in the words of john t daniels who lives in the outer banks the rights were two of the workingness boys he ever seen and when they worked they worked they had their whole heart and soul in what they were doing and the crazy thing is so they hired somebody back at their bicycle shop but the entire time they're doing this they can't disregard their business because they need the profits from the bicycle business to fund to fund their experiments and so they're going to have to cut their experiments short and go home i think this happens at least twice because they have to go manage their business so it says they went up building i'm skipping ahead here wilbur made one man flight this is before there's no engine so this is just essentially gliding they're just like learning and experimenting okay will were made one man flight after another how many is unknown because no one kept count he did record however flights of 300 to 400 feet in length and speeds of nearly 30 miles an hour to be off on their own in a setting so entirely different from any they had ever known and doing what mattered to them above all they had hoped to learn much of value and they did they had they had learned even more than they expected they felt they had found the way forward and so what that means is they did things in steps like first is okay can we can we build a glider can we figure out how to glide yeah once we figure out how to build a glider let what's the next step let's put a motor on the glider now the crazy thing is they have to go back home to work on their business they have to wait eight months in between experiments and while in those eight months they're working 12 to 14 hours a day every day except sunday on their bicycle shop right and then at night they do their experiments for their their flyer so says work at the bicycle shop continued for wilbur and orville much as much as usual over the next eight months but nothing so occupied their free time and thoughts as did preparations for their return to kitty hawk and so this entire time he's wilbur's been keeping up his correspondence with octave chenute that says when chenute wrote to tell wilbur that he expected to be passing through daton sometime soon he'd like to stop over wilbur said he and orville welcome the possibility of his visit but explained that the bicycle business being what it is occupied their attention 12 to 14 hours a day however they're entirely free on sundays and so he's obviously very impressed about the first experiments because it says to have a man of octave chenute standing come to call would be a high tribute he was not only one of the world's leading authorities on aviation but enjoyed an international reputation as an engineer and a builder of railroads and major bridges at age 70 chenute was short stout and dapper he was both kindly and manner and extremely talkative and so during the meeting he's like hey i have two other people that like they can come and and um and help you and it was really interesting because it says uh the two men with whom the uh he's like suggesting that hey when you go back to kitty hawk bring these two guys with them and it says although the brothers did not necessarily agree with chenute's philosophy that progress in science was always best served by everyone working openly together they accepted his suggestion if only out of respect and so they let these guys come along one of the guys they don't get along with at all but again i think just the fact that they they accepted it they prefer working alone and the fact that this just shows how much they respected uh chenute in the fact that they would accept other people um now they do something that's really important here they they they hire this guy named charlie taylor he's they hire him to run the bicycle business and he winds up becoming he's a really good mechanic so he winds up helping them build their first engine so this is really important but they said they hired him to to focus on the bicycle business so they can concentrate on their flying studies and experiments and really the note the note left myself on that page and the lesson i took away from that paragraph was that you should follow your energy they're extremely excited and think about their their flying experience all the time but they do have to pay their bills so that like if you can follow your energy and then hire someone to run your day job like you're going to succeed if you're naturally drawn if all you think about in your nights and your weekends and the time you're not working assuming it's not your day job and it's something else like that's an indication like your intuition telling you hey pay attention over here like focus follow your energy focus on if you can rearrange your life so you can actually work on the thing that you think about all the time i guess is the point here so after eight months they go back out to kitty hawk i'm just going to read a bunch of highlights here because this is all about like the entire book is just one struggle and one miserable thing after another that they have to overcome on the second expedition to kitty hawk they were to experience conditions that made those that they had known during their previous visits seem like a mere inconvenience they get there and it's there's like this this huge like almost like tropical storm it says it was an all-day drenching rain that they had to begin setting up their camp they then had to drive a pipe 10 to 12 feet into the ground to serve as a well because there was no source of fresh water within a mile of their camp because the new glider was so large the shed or hanger for it also had to be a good size they had to build a long solid shed that was 16 by 25 feet and six feet in height that would have been a considerable that would have been considered by many a substantial accomplishment in it in and of itself and they did it in remarkably little time then just as they were about to start working on the glider they were hit by a misery of a kind and on a scale that they had never experienced or imagined so every like 10 years in this area there's like this plague of mosquitoes and this happens to be the year that these mosquitoes appear the mosquitoes appeared in the form of a mighty cloud and almost darkened out the sun it was by far the worst experience of their life the agonies of typhoid fever were nothing by comparison there was no way of escaping the mosquitoes the sand and the grass and the trees and the hills and everything was fairly covered with them they chewed us clear through our underwear and socks lumps began swelling up all over our body like hens eggs oh until then the wind had been blowing at 20 miles an hour now it dropped off entirely and the summer heat kept mounting our blankets then became unbearable the perspiration would roll off us in torrents we would partly uncover and the mosquitoes would swoop down upon us in vast multitudes this second trip is an unmitigated disaster and we see that just i'm skipping over vast parts it says yet it is clear that they were as down in spirit about their work as they had ever been so nothing like they they're relying on these these past calculations they're not working their new glider is not working so it says it's not just that the machine had performed so poorly or that so much still remained to be solved but that so many of the long established supposedly reliable calculations and tables prepared by the likes of lillenthal lillenthal lillenthal prepared by the likes of lillenthal langley and chenute data the brothers had taken his gospel had proved to be wrong wilbur was at such a low point that he declared that not in a thousand years would man ever fly he is saying that in 1901 two years later they solve the problem of powered flight and so the important thing is they don't rest and like wallow in their despair the next day they're like all right we're gonna bounce right back at it wilbur's gloom was only momentary he was at work the following day and seemed to me he was more hopeful and determined than ever we knew that it would take considerable time and funds to obtain data of our own but there was some spirit that carried us through we had to go ahead and discover everything ourselves and so it's at this time that he's asked by chenute wilbur like come and address the society of engineers in chicago on the subject of your gliding experiments and it's his first request to speak in public and he was extremely reluctant he didn't want to do it the only reason he did is because he had great respect for chenute and essentially he's got imposter syndromes imposter syndrome here he was asked by his sister uh whether his talk would be scientific or witty he said it would be pathetic in the in his brief introduction chenute spoke of the advances made in aerial navigation by two gentlemen from daton ohio who were bold enough to attempt things neither he nor auto lindlenthal had dared to try that's another example of the great maxim that charlie mongers advised to you and i that you have to do things that other people are not doing you have to do things that other people are not doing the right brothers just happen to do that as well in this and they wind up making progress remember the problem is still not solved they're just a little further they're a little closer excuse me to the solution that other people have gotten and so says the speech was the book of genesis on the 20th century bible of aeronautics and why because he just talks very clear into the point very simple language it was the it was authentic wilbur right remember in the beginning of the book they said that both wilbur and orville never try to be anybody else anybody but themselves it's extremely important it was authentic wilbur right straightforward and clear this was the kind of uh so he talks about like why you have to put yourself in danger like you can't solve the problem of flight without with some risk of physical danger he says this is the kind of horse that men had to learn to manage in order to fly and there were two ways and he's got this great metaphor here that continues on the next page give me one second it says there's two ways that you're going to figure this out okay number one is to get on him and remember this is a metaphor and using a horse riding horses metaphor one is to get on him and learn by actual practice how each motion and trick may be best met the other is to sit on a fence and watch the beast for a while and then retire to your house and at leisure figure out the best way of overcoming his jumps and kicks the ladder system meaning just sitting there and watching is the safest but the former on the whole turns out the larger proportion of good riders if you really wish to learn you must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual trial and then he makes the point he's like all we need is more time like look at he uses a reference of lilinthal auto lilinthal he's like look how much he accomplished he goes lilinthal not only thought but he acted he demonstrated the feasibility of actual practice in the air which without success is impossible noting that lilinthal over a period of five years had spent no more than five hours in actual gliding and so he says like the issue is not that we're on the wrong path it's like we need more time in the air and he says what if a bicycle rider tried to ride through a crowded city after only five hours of practice and those five hours of practice being spread out in bits of 10 seconds over a period of five years this is like this is a fantastic point we just need more time and the book goes in like not only in response to over speech but everything it's like every newspaper famous person they're like essentially like the dream of flight is nothing more than a myth it's one of the quotes it's just like you're not like this is stupid you're wasting your time these people are nuts they're idiots like this is never going to work and so you like there's there's periods of complete indifference where the work of the right brothers is just being completely ignored and also and then it's either indifference where they're just completely ignored or it's ridicule and the right brothers just they have blinders on they don't even care they act the perfect way it's just like blinders on mentality i'm just working on like i'm working at this i don't care what other people think and part of that is because everybody's saying like oh the right brothers aren't going to be able to do it because this person didn't do it and that person didn't do it and look what happened to hero maxim and this guy over here and then i just double underline this one sentence i'm going to tell you whatever reminds me of his life but their tests were nothing like the meaning of the people that failed previously their tests were nothing like those of the brothers who proceeded entirely on their own and in their own way and so the way to think about the right brothers is they're they're in isolation doing the work and the research they eventually get the attention of the entire world and but before they get detention the entire world they get attention maybe one or two people but this that this entire section that's happening in the book has spread out over multiple pages it really made me think of what michael jordan said one time because this is a great analogy of what happened with him where he developed all these skills in private right and then he goes to his first like camp where he's put up against other people that are not living in north carolina and he absolutely dominates and and then all the schools out of somewhere out of nowhere like hey wait we thought we had we had known every single great basketball player in the country and then out of nowhere this guy named michael jordan this skinny dude comes and just dominates and so he says something about this because well he he's what michael's about to say here is when um at the time people kept saying you know it's kobe bryant the next michael jordan you know this is like the late 90s or whatever and michael says something here that i think i find over and over again in these books as an analogy and he says don't be in a rush to try to find the next michael jordan first of all you didn't find me i just happened to come along and you won't have to find that next person it is going to happen and the exact same thing is happening with the right brothers like we had we thought we knew the maxims the edisons the bells the langley's all these people making contributions uh to to attack this problem and yet all of a sudden these two brothers with no resources no education no friends in high places no little to no money come out of nowhere and they're not the important part is like no they're not asking for permission they're going out and doing this because first of all they're completely obsessed with it but they're also capable of independent thought which is what they learned from their father at the very beginning of the book and so they're making all these crazy they realize hey the numbers is you guys everybody else is using that those those books are cooked right that those are not useful numbers they build like this like primitive wind tunnel in the top of their freaking uh bicycle business and they're coming up like they figure out lift and all these like uh like aviation principles and i'm not going to speak out of turn here because most of the stuff i don't even understand but they send them out to to to octet to chenute and he's just like chenute was astonished by what you had to report it is perfectly marvelous marvelous to me how quickly you're getting results with your testing machine so again do things that other people aren't doing that's exactly what's taking place in this book i'm going to read a bunch of sentences that that everything i'm about to read to you is on the on the same page and i'll tell you what summary of what's happening here so says the work was unlike anything the brothers had ever undertaken in the most demanding of their time it was the most demanding of their time and powers of concentration they were often at it past midnight remember this is after they'd worked all day in their bicycle shop in december came another voice of scientific authority denouncing the dream of flight as a total sham so another example a calm survey of certain natural phenomena leads to the engineer to pronounce all confident prophecies for future success as wholly unwarranted if not absurd so i'm just bringing it to your attention because this is hitting the newspapers it's being talked about in public not the right brothers talking about the trying to people trying to learn how to fly because obviously that most people don't even know the right brothers exist and they just have to keep ignoring all this so it says uh chenute wrote to say how greatly he regretted their decision meaning that they like he's like essentially they have to to postpone their experiments because they have to get their next season of bicycle production completed and so she knew it's like yo let me just give you some money for some for sometimes she knew it had been offering to provide financial help to the brothers which they greatly appreciated but were unwilling to accept and he says what if some rich man were to provide ten thousand dollars a year chenute asked adding that he happened to know andrew carnegie personally it's fantastic wilbert tactfully declined he wants to be in control they had done it together on their own paying their own way as they did everything and they intended to keep going on their own these are missionaries so everything that i just read to you occurred on two pages and it's really this is the blueprint that they're using test iterate test iterate test iterate work long hours concentrate and ignore the naysayers so test iterate work long hours concentrate ignore the naysayers let's go back to that that two word summary of great startup founders that paul graham gave us relentlessly resourceful now they're back in kitty hawk the local residents had learned to love them in no smart because they could do anything they put their hands to there's a quote from a local resident the guy john t daniels they built their own camp they took an old carbide can and made a stove of it they took a bicycle and geared the thing up so it could ride on the sand they did their own cooking and and washing and they were good cooks too so they run into a problem they can't figure out and there's two things that are happening on this page number one give your brain a break it needs time like when you're not just don't keep adding stimuli don't like like just literally just sit there and do nothing stare out into the sky close your eyes do whatever to do but you have to give your brain a break so it can give time to process everything that you've taken in and so that for days they're hung up they just can't figure out the solution and so that night it says orville the discussion in camp that they had on aeronautical theory went on at such length that he indulged himself in way more coffee than usual this caused orville to be unable to sleep so he lay awake thinking just staring into the night where he's in a tent so he's just staring up at nothing thinking about ways to achieve an even better system of control when suddenly he had an idea the rear rudder instead of the rudder being in a fixed position which is what they had been doing it should be hinge it should be movable in the morning and breakfast he proposed a change but not before giving lauren a wink which is a single to watch wilbur for one of his customary critical responses so what do they mean by that this what wilbur is about to say here is exactly what i'm going to use jeff bezels as an example but jeff bezels is just one of the other founders that we've studied that says the exact same thing so he's like okay i'm going to propose an idea to my brother i'm going to wink to the other person sitting here because wilbur is never going to accept anything that i say like we have to fight over it first and then through that fighting we actually achieve like a better outcome a better idea so it says wilbur was always ready to jump into an argument with both sleeves rolled up and as wilbur himself would explain he believed in a good scrap it brought out new ways of of looking at things and it helped round off corner so what we're saying i want to have an argument i want to have a debate about the path forward i believe in a good scrap it brings out new ways of looking at things it helps round off corners in that book amazon unbound jeff bezos and the invention of a global empire which was founders number 180 jeff says if i have to choose between agreement and conflict i will take conflict every time it always yields a better result that is the same idea from jeff bezos 120 years after wilbur right this time however after a moment wilbur declared he liked the idea so it was such a good idea they didn't have to fight over it so you have all these visitors at the camp eventually they leave and they institute this new idea really the visitors they're very well meaning but this is the point their visitors can be well meaning so people essentially trying to take your your focus off your work they can be well meaning but they're also a distraction and so once they shed them their progress accelerates so since the brothers were on their own again and in 10 days of practice they made more glides than in all the preceding weeks so you got a bunch of other chefs in the kitchen all right they're trying to help they're trying to you know they're they're again well meaning is that i guess the best way to put that but they distracted them so much that once they left in 10 days they made more progress than they did in let's say in the previous 21 days and so once they make all these glides some of these glides are going 600 feet they're like okay we've reached step two and it took like three trips to get to step two and step two is you got to build a motor right so it says they knew this is going to remind me another thing that um that jeff bazer said in that book amazon unbound it's not this is my interpretation of what he said i don't have his exact quote but he talks about like when they're they've scaled many like 10 million dollar businesses to one to over a billion dollar businesses within amazon that's a large part of what that book's about on founders number 180 you can go back and listen to it but he says something about like you do tiny experiments but once you see traction once you see like promise the noise myself though i took what jeff was teaching us until like a maxim it says pour gasoline on promising sparks and that's exactly what the right brothers are about to do they knew exactly the importance of what they had accomplished they knew they had solved the problem of flight and more they had acquired the knowledge and the skill to fly they could soar they could float they could dive and rise circle and glide and land all with assurance now they only had to build a motor and so to me that's exactly it's jeff bezos's pour gasoline on promising sparks we apply it to company building they're applying it to flight once you know your product is right go default aggressive in scaling it that's what jeff is telling us pour gasoline on promising sparks once you know your product is right go default aggressive in scaling it and so they go back to ohio this is where they again they do what steve job said ask for help charlie charlie taylor was a better mechanic so he winds up helping them build an engine in like six weeks i just want to pull out one sentence here though this is fantastic and you might have experienced this i'm definitely experiencing right now with founders the deeper you go the more obsessed you will become our minds became so obsessed with it that we could do little other work that's how you know you're on the right path the deeper they go the more obsessed they become and now we get to what what i feel is really one of the most important ideas in the book it's something i remember from four years ago when reading it the first time it's something i try to do all the time and it's just well let me just read it to you asked what they thought of the experiments being conducted by alexander graham bell wilbur replied it is very bad policy to ask one flying machine man about the experiments of another because every flying machine man thinks that his method is the correct one over and over and over again in the book they're asked to comment on the work of others they did not like to pass criticism on the work of others they just focused on their own business i just think that's an extremely important idea and i think it ties together with this maxim that you and i talk about all the time that actions express priority you'll know my opinions on business because you'll see my philosophy and action as i build my company if you want in the rights brother's case like you know you already know what i think of alexander graham bells he's choosing a different method i think he's like putting something in like a somebody like a giant kite and it's going to fly in that way it's like okay if he wants to do that it's fine it's no business of mine you see what i want to do because i built a glider i practiced for many years now i'm putting a motor on that glider that's the way the path forward i think but i just think this idea where it's just like you just mind your own business i text this idea to a friend of mine and i'm just going to read what i text him i love what the right brother said about this paraphrasing at the time they had all these more famous and better funded competitors and when asked about them the right brother said they didn't need to comment on the work of others that everybody every person thinks their way is right and you can tell what we the right brothers believes believe based on what we do i really believe that's one of the most important ideas in the book there's one more problem they have to solve before they put the motor on think about when you're in a plane now has to build up speed you're probably going by like 100 100 miles an hour 180 i don't know what big big planes go before they take off so you need speed like how the hell are we going to get speed required to take off like this is a tiny like flyer and this is fantastic another illustration of relentless resourcefulness the flyer would be launched on a single wooden track that would serve like a railroad track that was 60 feet in length on which it would slide the total cost for materials for this innovation was four dollars and so right before they're about to make this breakthrough samuel langley does another attempt at launching remember this gigantic machine he's got prestige at the smithillian institution behind him he's got funding he's got the famous advisors he's got essentially everything right and everything the right brothers lack and he winds up failing and he gets completely like dragged through the mud by everybody and so there's a lot of lessons on this page here i'm going to tell you like the stuff that pops to my mind okay so skipping to after he'd fall failed and it also goes back to the what i feel is one of the most important ideas in the book it's like stop criticizing the work of others just like demonstrate what your beliefs or your philosophy and that philosophy is applied to your what you're creating right the company you're building and this is like it's also that we we're playing a dangerous game here okay so it says and you'll see what i mean i'm going to read this whole thing and then you'll see what i mean by that and i also want to quote stephen king because i thought he said something really really important and like he gave advice to people with like their um like your life's work so says langley would die three years later and he never got over the defeat and the humiliation so says neither brother was ever to make critical or belittling comments about langley rather they expressed respect and gratitude for the part he had played in their efforts just knowing that the head of the subsonian the most prominent scientific institution in america believed in the possibility of human flight was one of the influences that led them to proceed with their work and wilbur wrote he possessed talking about langley he possessed mental and moral qualities of the kind that influenced history when scientists in general considered it discreditable to work in the field of aeronautics he possessed both the discernment to discover possibilities there and the moral courage to subject himself to the ridicule of the public and the apologies of his friends he deserves more credit for this than he has received the treatment langley had been subjected to by the press and some of his professional friends had been shameful wilfers wilbur said his work deserve neither abuse nor apology and so wilbur was able to say that because he was away from it he wasn't langley right but langley dies never getting over the defeat and humiliation so the note i left myself is founders play a dangerous game with very real negative consequences and in the words of steven king you cannot come lightly to your work there is very real downsides not only could you be obviously embarrassed if you fail there's potentially catastrophic financial consequences for you and your family the upside is unlimited but there is very dangerous and very real negative consequences and i think steven king hit it he's right what i'm about to read to you comes from his book the autobiography i covered it back in 210 and he is writing he's giving advice to potential writers but it applies to founders entrepreneurs anybody's trying to do something difficult taking a risk in their life and steven says you can approach the act of writing with nervousness excitement hopefulness or even despair the sense that you can never completely put on the page what's in your mind in your heart you can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed ready to kick ass and take down names you can come to it because you want to want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world and then this is the punchline this is the important point that the really the point i'm trying to make here and i think what's taking place on this this page with this devastating you know defeat and loss of humiliation that that langley never overcomes and steven king says come to it anyway but lightly let me say it again you must not come lightly to the blank page and i think what steven king hasn't come with the right brothers with almost every single person or i would say every single person that we set in the podcast like there is no half asking it they're able to marshal all of their resources their mental energy their financial resources and their time and dedication to their work because there's very real downsides and it is entirely possible to still fail giving everything you have this is not a game so right after langley fails then the part of the book i read to you at the very beginning is when they do that historical flight and this is right after that so i'm skipping over it says we can celebrate for a day and then we're going to get back to work work at the bicycle shop resumed with as charlie taylor said no jig steps over what had been achieved of course they were pleased with the flight but the first word with me was about the motor being damaged they wanted a new one built right away they were always thinking of the next thing to do they didn't waste much time worrying about the past that's extremely important i double underlined it i'm going to read it to you one more time they were always thinking of the next thing to do they didn't waste much time worrying about the past you can you go to sleep on a wind you wake up with a loss so we're going to celebrate for a day it's fantastic achievement and then we're going to get back to work the next day i mean think about how crazy it is they just solved that they were the first humans ever to fly under powered flight and the first thing they say when they get back is hey we need to fix this new motor this is very similar again same mindset that the white brothers have michael jordan noticed in his autobiography which i covered back on founders number 213 look at what he says in this book and this is what i thought of this is the paragraph i thought of when i got to this section and michael says look around just about any person or entity achieving at a high level has the same focus the morning after tiger woods rallied to beat phil milkelson at the ford championship in 2005 he was at the gym by 6 30 a.m to work out no lights no cameras no glitz no glamour uncompromised absolutely remarkable that's the same idea noticed by both michael jordan and demonstrated by the actions of the right brothers this is so crazy they still have to run a profitable business to pay for their experiments they're not going to have a good deal money for like i think another two years from this point in the story nor could they neglect earning an income sufficient to cover both expenses at the shop and at home not to say the cost of their experiments as charlie taylor would repeatedly remind people there wasn't any other money to help cut expenses for continuing work on their flying machine it was decided that further expeditions to kitty hawk with all the with all the extra costs of travel and shipment of tools and material could be dispensed with by finding a suitable stretch of open land close to home to serve as a practice field so they had to spend the time and the energy going to kitty hawk when they were gliding right because they needed the wind they needed the sand because they knew they were gonna crash now they have powered flight they have an engine they like okay we can do the rest of our flying experiments in ohio and on the same page is just this fantastic fantastic paragraph with an absolute great last sentence it says the work to be done here the brothers knew could well be the final critical stage in the maturation of their whole idea something they've been working on for years at this point here they would have to learn to do far more than they had at kitty hawk they must master the art of launching themselves safely into the air of banking and turning a motor propelled machine and landing safely therefore this is a fantastic last sentence therefore wilbur stressed they would have to learn to accommodate themselves to the circumstances and right after this great triumph the euphoria we know what falls next the terror always but they always there there there's always a setback that they have to persevere through but again that's great positive mental attitude is always maintained by the right brothers maybe a day or two they might feel sorry for themselves but they give it right back up almost nothing went right for the next three months there was nothing spectacular about these many trials but the good humor of wilbur after a spill or a crash in the machine or something breaking or a stubborn motor wilbur was always reassuring their patient perseverance their calm faith and ultimate success their mutual consideration of each other might have been considered phenomenal after every trial the two inventors held long and confidential consultations with one another with always some new gain some new insight they were getting nearer and nearer the moment when sustained flight would be made for a machine that could maintain itself aloft for two minutes they said might just as well stay there for an hour and so they're in this place called huffman prairie in ohio and they're just doing now they've figured it out so they're doing one flight after another after another after the only people noticing like some most people are just completely indifferent and so i'm going to read this sentence this paragraph to you remind me of something that edwin land the founder of polaroid and steve jobs hero said i think this is this is pretty sure this is from founders number 40 i'll read to you in a minute so it says have you heard of what they're out they're up to out there people in town would say oh yes and the conversation would move on few took any interest in the matter or in the two brothers who were to become datin's greatest heroes ever even those riding the train so this is like this this trolley or this like uh like this public transportation line that goes right by the field where they're doing these flights and people don't even give shit it says even those right even those writing the line seem to have paid little or no attention to what could occasionally be seen in passing are to the brothers themselves that they traveled back and forth from town on the same trolley looking little different from other commuters edwin land said this the test of an invention is the power of an inventor to push it through in the face of staunch not opposition but indifference in society let me read that to you again the test of an invention is the power of the inventor to push it through in the face of staunch indifference in society more likely than somebody opposing you is somebody not even caring what you're doing that is a default mode for humans they're just concerned with their own day in life so edwin land's advising us like your biggest problem is after you've invented something that the world is is worth having that it's valuable to other humans like you've got to learn to push it through indifference and you keep pounding away at it and eventually just like one person's interested then two people are interested and i'm talking about the right brothers then 30 people are interested and then soon they're filling up stadiums of 200 000 people on multiple continents wanting to watch their product demonstrations but that's not happening in this point the story people aren't even bothered to know are bothered to care so in all of these books there's always like these interesting supporting characters and i love this guy so this is guy this guy is one of the first people that actually takes notice and he it's like his job to publicize this miracle that's happening so says his name was amos root he stood no more than five foot three but his energy and curiosity were great indeed he was born in a log cabin started his own business which was manufacturing and marketing beekeeping supplies all the way back in 1869 when he was 30 years old and soon became widely known as the bee man of ohio at 64 now this is 34 years after he founded his business at 64 he was extremely well off happily married a father five proud grandfather and quite free to pursue a whole range of active interest this guy is default alive amos root bubbled with enthusiasm and a constant desire to see the wheels go round he enjoyed conveying his thoughts and ideas on a host of other topics in a column that he wrote for his company's beekeeper trade journal gleanings and bee culture so he's got essentially it would be like the equivalent like a newsletter in our day right he's got this email newsletter like his his times version of this email newsletter and it just happens to be in this beekeepers trade journal this is insane what i'm about to read to you it was he of all people the ohio bee man who would recognize as no one yet had the genius of the rights and the full importance of their flying machine it was not the date and local papers that finally broke the story the story or the chicago tribune or the new york times or the scientific american but amos's roots own gleanings in bee culture that made me laugh out loud when i got to that like the first major attention they get with what's happening in huffman prairie comes from amos root writing in a bee keeping trade journal that's bananas and so he winds up writing and he the the the white brothers liked him because he's no fluff would keep his word like they're just very practical people says so it says god in his great mercy has permitted me to be to be at least somewhat instrumental in ushering in and introducing to the great wide world an invention that may outrank electric cars the automobiles and may fairly take a place besides the telephone and wireless telegraphy route would begin his eyewitness account he had been astonished oh so he talks about before describing what he saw happen he made a point of stressing that the rights were like they were extremely well rounded and they had an like obviously spent their entire like childhood and youth being encouraged by their father to read like widely and she makes that point he's like what the hell like they're not only like gifted in building these machines but like they're extremely well read and can and talk about a lot of topics he had been astonished by the extent of their library and to find in conversation that they were thoroughly versed not only in regard to our present knowledge but everything that had been done in the past remember it started out to begin the book they talked about like wilbur read everything but his first love was reading about history and so amos is picking that up he's like wow this guy's not only knows what's going on now but everything they've been done in the past back to roots writing amos is writing root pictured a wondrous time nearly hand when we should we should not need to fuss with roads or railway tracks or bridges as such enormous expense with these machines we would bid adieu to all of these things god's free air that extends all over the earth and perhaps miles above us is our training field and then it goes into why the rights liked him why because they didn't want to give access to anybody and says why they put such trust and root was never explained but clearly they had much in common he too in the early days of his beekeeping enterprises was called a nut he had succeeded with his ideas only by close study so they're just talking about what they have in common he succeeded with his ideas by close study importantly beginning with his first visit he had showed himself true to his word and ready to cooperate in any way he could to achieve accuracy in what he wrote like their father he was a man of strong religious convictions as their father was a was a preacher by trade and it was of no small importance that bishop right approved of root he wrote in his diary mr root is a fine gentleman perhaps above all wilbur and orville knew from their first meeting with root that his regard for them was altogether genuine his belief in the possibility of human flight was no less than their own so i mentioned earlier there's just fantastic one-liners all over in the book this is one of the best quotes in the entire book the best dividends on labor invested they said have invariably come from seeking more knowledge rather than more power so it says they both said it not sure if it was wilbur or orville but it says the best dividends on the labor invested have invariably come from seeking seeking more knowledge rather than more power so the first people interested in buying airplanes as you could might imagine would be military first the u.s military wasn't interested but the french military understood it completely immediately so this is the first airplane sale in the week of 1905 in the last week of 1905 bishop right recorded in his diary a frenchman by the name of arnold no idea how to pronounce his last name came to investigate and drive a trade for a flying machine they agreed on terms arnold represented represented a syndicate of wealthy french businessmen he said but the rights assumed that the deciding authority would be the french military which was indeed the case they agreed to sell one to buy one machine for two hundred thousand dollars this is gonna blow your mind too five thousand dollars was to be deposited in a new york bank in escrow the five thousand dollars the brothers were to receive however the further negotiations went would more than cover all of their expenses they had since first going to kitty hawk so the american government american people were a little slow on realizing how important this was they said the french got it right away so they go to europe to do demos an entirely new adventure had begun unlike anything he or any of the family had experienced wilbur had just turned 40 he will be dead five years from now from typhoid fever and was to be on his own far from home separated from his family for longer than he ever been had been or ever imagined and tested in ways that he had never been so he goes to paris eventually he's going to do his first uh demos at lamans but there's just one paragraph that jumped out on me and it's the importance of living life to the fullest and again this is extremely important considering he doesn't know he only has five years left he would fill his free time in paris to advantage with the same level of intensity he brought to nearly everything making the most of every waking hour in what for all he knew might be his one and only chance for such an opportunity so then he starts not only does the french government want to buy these things a bunch of other rich companies and rich entrepreneurs want to buy it and this is what i referenced earlier why he was like oh i'm never going to be cut off for this turns out he's like one of these like universal geniuses like claude shannon was not so many years before wilbur had decided he was unsuited for commercial pursuits now he find himself he found himself in the thick of extremely complex commercial dealings playing for extremely high stakes with highly experienced entrepreneurs politicians and bureaucrats and in a language he neither spoke nor understood the whole game the players the setting the language were new to him yet he was more than holding his own and in good spirits wilbur was never rattled he never lost his confidence he could be firm without being dictatorial disagree without causing offense nor was there ever a doubt that when he spoke he knew what he was talking about more importantly he remained entirely himself never straying from his direct unpretentious way with good effect so he travels from paris to lamans he's going to start doing public demonstrations i want to read a description of this this is really important because this is something so claude hopkins founder's number 170 probably the greatest copywriter to ever live and think about he spent every waking hour he wind up claude hopkins essentially worked from home by himself with a typewriter just him and his like spending all these hours he made the equivalent of like four million dollars what would be four million dollars a year in today's money right working by himself just writing copy that sold other people's products right he makes more money later on when he starts taking ownership and products and stuff but somebody dedicated his entire life to persuasion and to writing copy makes the point that no argument in the world can ever compare with one dramatic demo that if you want to sell something demo like let people see what your product does that is better than anything you could possibly write coming from a guy that dedicated his life to writing sales copy and so the right brothers is an example of that it was nearly three in the afternoon by the time wilbur opened the shed doors and the gleaming white flyer was rolled into the sunshine he continued to fuss with it he then walked the full length and width of the field made sure the starting rail was headed exactly into the wind so this is the reason i'm reading to you because he was he always had to do everything himself he was completely obsessed he checked the catapult to see if it was all in order and then supervised the raising of the iron weight the iron weight just dropped it's like thrown down that's where they're getting the propulsion sends it down the track builds up the speed needed to lift off okay he was never hurried in the least finally at 6 30 three and a half hours later wilbur said quietly gentlemen i'm going to fly he took his seat two men started the engine not satisfied with something he heard as the motor was warmed up wilbur called to a mechanic who was standing at the back of the machine to ask if a small last minute adjustment had been made the man said it had wilbur sat silent for a moment then slowly leaving his seat he walked around the machine just to make sure with his own eyes that this particular adjustment had without the slightest shadow of a doubt been well and truly made back again in his seat wilbur released the trigger the weight dropped and down the rail and into the air he swept cheers went up as he sailed away he banked to the left turned in a graceful curve and came flying back towards the grand scan grandstand very near the point where he had started he made another perfect turn and flew a full circle once again the crowd was ecstatic cheering shouting hardly able to believe what they had seen that summer saturday in lamans france one american pioneer had at last presented to the world the miracle that he and his brother had created on their own and in less than two minutes demonstrated for all who were present and to an extent no one had had anywhere on earth had yet on anywhere on earth that a new age had begun and this demonstration is going to go on for quite a while they're going to do it all over europe his brother's going to do it back in washington this is when the entire it goes from you know they're having a fight against the difference to they can't walk out of their house like they are now global global celebrities for the rest of their lives so that tipping point has finally they finally achieve that tipping point where they're no longer laboring obscurity and so now we get more of his personality traits this is why he's in europe wilbur wright is the best example of strength and character that i have ever seen in spite of the sarcastic remarks and the mockery in spite of the traps set up everywhere all over the years he has not faltered he is sure of himself sure of his genius and he kept his secret he's a shy simple man but also a man of genius who could work alongside the men of the factory just as he could work entirely alone he could cook his own meals and do whatever else was necessary under almost any conditions and he was quiet by nature he went his way always in his own way that's another great sentence he went his way always in his own way never showing off never ever playing to the crowd the impatience of a hundred thousand persons could not accelerate the rhythm of his stride that is an actual quote that's something to happen you got there's like all this pressure because you got a hundred thousand people waiting for you to do something and if he didn't think that the flyer was ready or the weather was good enough he'd just say i'm not flying today he did not care they had discovered how exceptionally cultured wilbur was how in rare moments of relaxation he talked with authority of literature art history music science architecture the devotion of this preacher's son to his calling this is such a great sentence too i'm going to start it over the devotion of this preacher's son to his calling was very like that of a gifted man dedicating his life to a religious mission so while wilbur is doing the demonstration in europe orville starts putting on flying demos in washington so says orville and the flyer remain in the air for more than four minutes circling the prairie ground five and a half times under perfect control covering three miles with no mishap in the days that fall followed orville provided one sensational performance after another breaking one world record after another as never before the two bicycle mechanics quote unquote and their flying machines were causing simultaneous sensations on both sides of the atlantic they had become a transcontinental two-ring flying circus and i mentioned earlier that orville fell from 75 feet and i'm going to skip over that part but i want to talk about he's in serious condition and this is where his father like we see that they just got a fantastic father and so he's writing to his son he wrote to orville clearly from the heart i am afflicted with the pain you feel and sympathized with the disappointment which has postponed your final success in aeronautics but we are all thankful that your life has been spared and are confident of your speedy though tedious recovery and of your triumph in the future as in the past then in the way of a fatherly sermon he added we learn much better by tribe by tribulation and by adversity our hearts are made better they've just got a father that just absolutely believes in them and supports them 100 you just couldn't ask for more skipping ahead willbers giving another speech just before he leaves europe he's going to go back home he goes to europe several times after this too so i just want to he just gives us a great speech just want to pull out a couple highlights from the speech this is wilbur speaking in the enthusiasm being shown around me i see not merely an outburst intended to glorify a person but a tribute to an idea that has always impassioned mankind i sometimes think that the desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who in their grueling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times looked enviously on the bird soaring freely through space at full speed above all obstacles on the infinite highway of the air 10 years ago all hopes of flying had almost been abandoned abandoned even the most convinced had become doubtful and i convinced and i confessed that in 1901 i said to my brother that men would not fly for 50 years two years later we ourselves were making flights this demonstrated my ability inability this demonstration of my inability as a prophet gave me such a shock that i have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction but it is not really necessary to look too far into the future we see enough already to be certain that it will be magnificent only let us hurry and open the roads and eventually orville recovers his leg is a little shorter uh he has to he like walks with a limp he winds up outliving his brother by 36 years but he does wind up being able to fly again before i get there there's just another fantastic quote and this one comes from wilbur right and he says a man who works for the immediate present and its immediate rewards is nothing but a fool and i'll just close on this section that made me smile when i read it of the immediate family only bishop right had yet to fly nor had anyone of his age ever flown anywhere on earth he had been with the brothers from the start helping in every way he could never losing faith in them are their aspirations now at 82 with the crowd cheering he walked out to the starting point where orville without hesitation asked him to climb aboard they took off soaring over 350 feet for a good six minutes during which the bishop's only words were higher orville higher and that is where i'll leave it i highly highly recommend you buy the book i think it belongs in every founders library this is a great quote from the ceo of google on the back and he says a story that resonates with anyone who believes deeply in the power of technology to change lives and i didn't see that till after i read reread the book and that's just perfect that's just a fantastic way to put it there's a link in the show notes if you buy the book using the link you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time there's also a link in the show notes and at founders podcast.com in case you want to give a gift description to a friend a co-worker or a family member you can do that that's a great way to support the podcast at the that's a great way to support the podcast as well that is 239 books down 1000 to go and i'll talk to you again soon
