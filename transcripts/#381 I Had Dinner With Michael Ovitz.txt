Something that michael over time, people like steve jobs and jeff is the belief that you must find and work with extraordinary people even when over to the young man starts company has no money. He makes a list of people that he eventually work with any was the best of the best and even though at the time it felt like a pipe dream he actually makes that list into a reality. And the importance of working with the very best people there's actually great observation about this from steve jobs and he says that the key observation was that i notice. That the dynamic range between what an average person could accomplish and what the best person could accomplish was fifty to one or a hundred to one. So given that you're well advised to build a team that pursues the a plus players that's exactly what steve jobs did exactly what michael oversted and is exactly what ramp did ramp has the most talented technical team in their industry. Becoming an engineer ramp is nearly impossible last twelve months they hired only point two three percent. Of the people that applied so that means when your business is using ramp you now have access to top tier technical talent and some of the best engineers on the planet working on your behalf twenty four seven to automate and improve all of your businesses financial operations ramp invest heavily in creating new innovative products in fact. I just sat down with the founder and a friend of mine. Who's the one of the co-founders and the CEO of ramp name eric and he told me that fifty four percent of their payroll is now dedicated to r and d so the longer they use ramp the more efficient your company becomes that's very important because as sam walton astutely pointed out in his autobiography. He wrote you can make a lot of different mistakes to still recover if you run an efficient operation or you can be brilliant and go out of business if you're too inefficient ramp helps you run an efficient organization over its nose. That ramp built a team of a post players because of its invested in ramp so from a customer's perspective what does a team of a plus player sounds like sounds like this customer review that i read which said ramp is like having a teammate who you never need to check in on because they have it handled. So take the time set up a demo of the product and you'll see why many of the world's top founders are running their company on ramp you can do that by going to ramp.com go to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today that is ramp.com. Okay so last week i flew to new york to have dinner with michael over to wind up having a very intense and entertaining three hour conversation. And i made a list of things i learned from the dinner so i'm just gonna run through some of these ideas i guess i should back up and tell you how i actually got connected to over its. We wind up i didn't know this but we end up having a very close mutual friend i'm having breakfast with my friend rick. And his phone is on the table and it rings and it says michael over so i go wow and so he picks it up and he's like hey i'm actually here with my friend david sender he does this podcast you might have heard of it's called founders and there's a there's a short break and then over says i listen to four of them yesterday. And so we wind up getting connected and i were planning on having a meeting and having dinner anyways and i say yeah as you might know i do these like i had dinner episodes i've done one with charlie monger and sam zell. And brad jacobs and john mackie i think it'd be really interesting would you be up to doing it and he said yes so i flew up to see him. Conversation was really intense it flew by like i said it was three hours i was shocked when i got up from the table and i thought you know maybe we talked for an hour. So right after dinner i don't record any of this and i don't take notes while we're having a conversation so i just write down some of the things that really stood out to me. And then i try to expound on them so i have a just a list of about 10 ideas i want to go over with you from this dinner and the number the first one that's very obvious if you read his autobiography which i'm also doing an episode on and i think i'll just release it at the same time. And if you spend any time with them or hear him speak in any capacity there's this great line that i kind of use this like a guide to make sure that i'm on the right path and it says mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. And this is very obvious if you look at his career but he's still like this to this day and what i would say is like obis does nothing in a casual manner and i don't either i don't think any of the founders of you and i study or read biographies. About do either and like one of my favorite examples of this and he was like this when he was like a young kid he starts working in the mail room at william morris and. The extra length i think there was like i think in the book says there was something like 20 other trainees you know he's one of 20. And i was 20 people there's only one that did what he did and he noticed that hey there's this filing cabinet room he says the length of a basketball court. And it's lined with steel cabinets and he calls it the hard drives of the era you know there's no computers back then no internet night anything like that. And what you realize is like this this this these filing cabinets that are the length of a basketball court they actually hold 70 years of history on hollywood. And he says i view those files as an encyclopedia of entertainment while other trainees wanted to be told what to do and read and learn each morning at seven. And every evening after work for 10 weeks i made my way through every single file from a to z how many other trainees did that zero. He does over and over again is a bunch of different examples but one of my favorite stories in the book too. What is he trying to sign this very important director and who the director at the time was being wrapped by this aging and really apathetic agent. And so what over it does keep in mind mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. Maybe the director thought hey that i've been with this agent for a while seems to be going well seems to be fine and then you have somebody with passion that showing up and exposing how mediocre your alternative is. And he winds up working on this director for two hours a day for two years. Before the director signs with them and one of the smartest things that that over steady is like i made sure to get him every single script the best scripts before his own agent got the scripts to him so such a working on his behalf and showing him how important was and showing him that i can actually the difference between. You know your your apathetic agent and me is vast so mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it the second thing that popped in my mind. Is don't put any ceiling on where you can push your profession so Kobe Bryant Michael Jordan actually shared the same. The same trainer getting Tim Grover and he wrote two books about what it was like working very closely with them you know basic spending every day with them. And there's two lines that popped in my mind when after I was thinking about the conversation how it over it. And Tim Grover writes the greats figure out what works for them regardless of what everyone else does. Number two everyone wanted to be like Mike Mike did not want to be like anyone else and so if you actually analyze how. There are there are talent agents before you know Michael was born there's talent agents to this day and yet. What are the things that is most fascinating about his story is like he just he figured out what worked for him he didn't really care what other agents were doing in fact. He maybe looked at what other ages were doing is what not to do or what to like basically attack areas that they weren't doing so one of the innovations he had was. Decide the decision that hey we're all going to service every single agent inside of CA is going to service the clients together we it's like a giant swarm of agents where. In the past you know you are you are assigned to one person you only worked with one person. And that caused all kind of internal conflict and you weren't it's just a lot better five people servicing you than one person you know wind up working out a lot better for for the talent that's the assigned. And then he didn't just stay there's like oh okay what are we supposed to do there's a great story where it's like most talent agents what would they do they would field. Offers like okay there's 10 offers with the choose between them maybe negotiated a little higher salary cases like no we're going to we're not going to feel opportunities we're going to create them. And then that led to the next thing where hey we're going to create entire packages for the studios which also helped him control prices and make more revenue for the agency and then from there. He's like what else can I do I'm going to get into corporate M&A no other talent like no other talent agency none of his other competitors were even thinking like this. And the size and scope of his ambition again no don't put any ceiling where you can push your profession you know just pursue the opportunities. And she's have them he winds up brokering like multiple billion dollar deals I think what I think one of them was like six and a half billion dollars. No again no other none of the other competitors know their agent was doing this he doesn't stop there says hey we're gonna start being marketing and advertising consultants for giant companies like coca cola. And one of the things that he said at dinner is like if you're going to do things like this when you do new things you will be criticized. And in that case you be criticized by outsiders but people outside of your company now number two no ceiling don't put any ceiling on where you can push your profession is also related to number three. Because for number two you're going to be criticized out by by people outside your company number three is I grew up going to church Christian church every week. For my entire childhood and I remember one of the one of the lessons that they would repeat over and over again is the importance of not being they said don't be unequally yoked. And I think they meant just in relationships in general but I specifically remember saying like you know make sure you're not you don't marry people outside of faith they have different you know beliefs in you. And the vice movers is like you need to make sure that you're picking partners to have the same ambition issue and so when I think about that I think of don't be unequally yoked. And when you're when you have no ceiling on where you can push your profession you're going to be criticized by outsiders could you do new things. What if you have picked partners that don't have the same ambition levels of you. And you try to do new things like all the things I just listed you're actually also going to be criticized by insiders which are people inside your company your co founders. I mean it's going to lead to a lot of conflict and you know there's all kinds of stories in this autobiography which I'll go over in the episode I make on it it's a huge part of the story. And he says this will manifest he was saying at dinner like the way this is manifest is like your partners will call it a distraction. And you know if you believe in it like it's not it's probably not that it's a distraction it's just they're not thinking as big as you are. And you might find yourself he didn't use this word but on you unequally yo just the way I think about it. When we talked about the issues with co founders and how to maybe avoid all this and really like what he learned from this. What I found that was remarkable because I know now he has new partners and he's scaling other companies and he's and I know his partner. I asked like how are you able to trust because two of his partners that screwed him over. I would like to have his best friends to answer why I asked him like how do you trust partners after being fucked over. And I thought his answer was because you know I keep people at arm's length I have a hard time trusting other people. Maybe a detriment and he had a great perspective on this he's like you know three people screwed me over my life. He's like but it's three out of a thousand and he's not going to let three out of a thousand people you know foreclose any future opportunity. And being able to partner with people that aren't going to screw him over I thought that was really interesting number four read biographies know everything about the history. Of your industry there's a line this is tied to a line that that over said to me where he says only founders understand founders. So the first thing that popped to my mind is on page 179 of his autobiography talks about that. Lou he modeled himself after Lou Wasserman there's a biography on Lou I have I think it's called like the last mogul or the last tycoon the last thing was like the last Hollywood mogul. And I asked over to dinner I was like do you still like think Lou Wasserman was the best and he said yes. And one of the benefits of reading biographies is obviously like over start doing this you know he starts working when he's like nine years old by the time he's high school he's like. Veraciously reading biographies of men that did great things and you know he read the Carnegie and the Rockefeller and all these people. He read all the biographies of all the people in Hollywood that came before him. And I think the important thing is what he's saying is like only founders understand founders and so as you understand these life stories as you listen to this podcast you read biographies yourself. Like you just realize like oh that's just like another me and we're going through the exact same thing he actually gave me advice to he's like you should really lean into more the more unknown founders. Because you know he had read about the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers and the Carnegie's and the Ford but he thought it was an edge. To introduce people to other incredible founders that very few people have heard of before so like Daniel Ludwig the invisible billionaire Chung Ju Young which is the craziest autobiography of my life. Sam's a Murray Estee Lauder another example even if you know the company name. Very few people probably thought you know I should see if that person has built this massive company I wonder if they have an autobiography or a biography about them and then even less people would actually go and read it. So again read biographies know everything about the history of your industry number five have a profound sense of belief. And as you'll understand like the world is also malleable so there's a reason this is number five and read rather than before because you learn this if you read a bunch of biographies. And this is the things one of the things I most admire about obits there's a lot of things like I love the fact that this guy never gives up. And he's still pushing himself he's in his late seventies and he's got tons of energy and he's working really hard. But he has got a great line is autobiography where he says nothing in Hollywood is anything until it's something and the only way to make it something is with a profound display of belief. If you keep insisting insisting that a shifting set of possibilities is a movie it eventually becomes one. So mark and recent who actually modeled his venture firm and recent Horowitz on what obits did at CIA had a very similar line and this is the way he describes what I feel is the same exact phenomenon. And mark wrote the world is a very malleable place if you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion. The world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. And so obits doesn't see things as they are now he sees what they could be and then he proceeds to make that idea into a reality and the number six when you speak to him. You I got the feeling that he just thought that like there's unlimited opportunity in the world and surprisingly enough I think something he learned earlier and I think so plus this day's like this is a lot of opportunities just hiding in plain sight. And I think you have some level of like self confidence when you're able to pick something up that off the ground like people kind of like threw away or didn't do anything with and you turn into something that's insanely valuable and I think that's related to. Number two which is you know just don't put a ceiling on there's really no ceiling where you can push your profession so you know there's a ton of examples in the book but like. He turned show gun into this massive mini series I think it's the second most watched mini series of all time and that opportunity was sitting inside of another agency and the other agency was doing any anything with it for years he finds another script for this movie called to see. Again six years was considered dead this is impossible this isn't an opportunity winds up making makes a couple hundred million dollars in profit. Rain man which is one of my favorite movies I watched it I don't even know how many times when I was a kid same thing other people couldn't get it done. Other people said no one's going to watch this movie about this autistic guy makes well over 400 million dollars there's always opportunity hiding in plain sight and there's unlimited opportunity in the world and I feel like this has been coming up a lot if you look at the past few episodes. Like think about Leon Hess right literally builds the Hess family just sold the business for 53 billion dollars right what how does that business start that starts with Leon Hess. Who realizes hey you're throwing out a bunch of oil and because you think it's not valuable I'm going to start my empire with the stuff that you're throwing away just like Sam's a Murray did the exact same thing with in his banana trade. Right you're throwing out the rights I would that's you're throwing in a trash I see that I don't see it's trash I see this opportunity hiding in plain sight Jerry Jones Dallas Cowboys he paid 140 million for their worth 10 billion today. 75 people turned down the opportunity to buy the Cowboys before Jerry Jones did if you're capable of thinking for yourself if you have profound self belief there's always opportunity hiding in plain sight number 7 by endurance we conquer one of my favorite try my favorite line in the entire book. And I don't remember what the context of the discussion we were having at dinner but we did talk about this and we both look at this the exact same way. But this line says he stopped because it was hard it required discipline dedication and hours and hours of time everyone stopped I didn't stop. That's related to one of my all time favorite observations and quotes by Steve jobs where he says Steve said I'm convinced that about half of what separates the success of entrepreneurs from the unsuccessful ones is pure perseverance unless you have a lot of passion about this you're not going to survive you're going to give up and actually think it's related. He was talking about the difference between like his mentality and maybe some of the younger people that work in their company today where they don't understand like how they just haven't gone through life enough so you know it's really hard to understand until you go to get off like just how difficult and how much adversity you're going to have to constantly push through and like what Steve just said listen you're going to do is all kinds of crap and most of you are just going to wash out I think in that trainee program. That over started as a young man I think eighty percent of the trainees that all start in the mail room they're trying to be talent agents from the time is in the mail room to the time they actually come in like eighty percent wash out one of the things I think that he can that the young people that work with him today can benefit from is one they see how fast. He wants to move and how fast he wants to push and there was an example where you know he asked for something and maybe it was on like a Thursday night. And it's still not there on Sunday and the person's like all get in a few days he's like when I said when I asked you on Thursday night I expected to have it on Friday morning. This person was shocked at the pace that obits wanted to move at in fact one of my favorite stories is in her killer her his biography her killer her was the founder of Southwest Airlines the most successful airline in history. Under herb's leadership they were being profitable for something like forty straight years and so I want to read this excerpt from her killer hers biography which I think is absolutely excellent. Says her killer her illustrates the speed with which Southwest moves by telling a story about Don Valentine the former that's a funny. I give you an indication of where we're going here right the former VP of marketing Valentine had just joined Southwest from Dr Pepper when the marketing group met in January to discuss a new television campaign. Valentine was ready with his timeline for producing the spots okay you just came over come over from Dr Pepper you're now Southwest you're going to give a presentation to the founder. The founder of Southwest we have a great idea here okay this is what I do this is the timeline it's in January okay so we're in January I'm going to have the script ready in March we're going to do the script approval in April. We're going to cast the commercial in June and we're going to shoot it in September when Valentine finished Kelleher said Don I hate to tell you but we're talking about next Wednesday. So again a lot of people just don't know how fast you can move and as the leader of your company should really be pushing the pace and show them what's possible. Number eight this is very very interesting and I wrote very few things down I tried to go into these conversations obviously prepare because I read about them and everything else but I don't have like a list of things I want to talk about. What this is one of the things I want to talk about so there was this young guy who obits admired effect effect I think he started a talent agency even like a younger age. No it's it I think this guy was like 23 and it was like 27 and wind up building a relationship Ted his name is Ted and. In the book it talks about giving advice and seeing how how you know how much of it is pushing. He said I have a piece of advice and knowing you you're not gonna take it but here it is I could have worked 10% less and it wouldn't have made a difference in my professional success but it would have been a lot happier. Ted was absolutely right on both accounts it was great advice and I didn't take it. I see now that it could have worked as much as 20% less and it wouldn't have cost me it would have cost me if I worked even 10% less across 30 years that's three extra whole years of life that it would have enjoyed so this is one thing I did ask him at dinner is like do you still believe that. You know he's he pushes the pace over to still working on an unbelievable amount of hours. But he told me is passing yes but not on the rise you know I think I forgot the number he told me but I think within the first 10 years of CAA. Ten years after founding a company that had something like 75% market share of you know his industry. And so he's like then you could work you know 10% less and I should have worked 10% less you might not be able to do that especially as you know they were completely under. Finance there's no venture capital there literally like they had no money they were taking second loans out on their houses for God's sake they had like no furniture. He was under intense financial pressure right from day one but he did this is the advice he would give now. Is it you know work 10% less and really I think what what is stated there by Ted's advice and then over it's also agree with that advice is like. Really important to optimize for the long term you know most of the profits in a business is very far out you know decade two decades in the future think about the money that Microsoft makes today compared to what they made in 1990. Apples the same way oracle walmart you know these things can compound for long if all the values out in the future your the advice is like. Make sure you're not optimizing for growth at the expense of durability you want to be you want your company to be around you want to still be doing what you're doing 20 years from now 30 years from now 40 years from now some of the best entrepreneurs. I told you before I that I meet are in their 70s and they've been running their business for 45 years and if you see it doesn't look like a company looks like they have their own world it's incredible. And all the profits are in the future so I think what the advice here is again you really need to optimize for the long term and if that means you push back you cut back 10% but you're still there. You know two decades in the future and it's obviously a trade that you want to make number nine. This is very fascinating because he repeats the server again surround yourself with people who tell you the truth he said I cannot stand yes men. And what happened because you know obits was in a glamorous business and then he did not like the publicity it's mentioned over time over and over again the book it causes problems with his partners it caused problems with his clientele because it's clientele or you know they're obsessed with fame and they want to be the ones getting the attention. This happens with any kind of success whether it's in the show business or even in just a regular commercial business you're going to have people because it's their best interest they just they're going to say. They're not going to tell you the truth the close friend that me and over to share Rick. What's told me he's fiercely loyal to him because he says Rick tells him the truth that he is direct and truthful and he's. Not trying to he understands like he's not telling me bad things to be needlessly critical or to try to hurt my feelings or anything like that he's telling him because we're friends and your friends tell you the truth. And over to did this with me he actually told me a few things that he thinks i'm doing wrong or I could be doing better. And he could be right about that and definitely would think about it but I went and actually pulled up I talked about this at dinner but then I after dinner when. Was I asked sage like what did history's greatest entrepreneurs say about the importance of getting unfiltered and truthful information about. About your business from the people that work with you and how did they ensure that they got the best and most accurate information about the state of their business and there's a bunch of examples. Of this one of them was an early days Amazon Jeff insisted that customers could email him directly at Jeff at Amazon.com. And then he received unfiltered customer feedback because again if you're just getting your information through your executives right. They want to tell you the good news this is what Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett warned about over and over again and they would tell people it's like the good news takes care of itself. I don't even need to hear about that tell me the bad news and tell me fast because we don't let we don't let bad news fester. The founder of kinko's power of Paul or failure same thing he had a voicemail system where any employee could leave him a message directly he could he was dyslexic so. He's not reading emails to just call me tell me what the hell is going on on the front lines Sam Walton he did not want to spend time in his office. Right there hilarious stories in his autobiography and his biography where Sam would not adhere to a calendar. And so you know his secretary would set up like you know some appointment at like 7am in his office and Sam's not showing up and like where is he like oh he left at 5am gotten his little sessna and you flew to another walmart door. And he's like working and asking questions from the workers on the front line that is how he knows he's getting unfiltered truthful information. About the state of his business Jim Casey same thing ups founder what would he do he made his driver. He instructed driver every time we pass that these big brown trucks pull over and he goes and he talks introduce himself and he talks directly. Get direct information directly from the people that are actually delivering the service to the customer and finally number 10 retirement is lame that's a quote from Jeff Bezos who gave this interview. At the deal book summit a few weeks ago I made an episode on it he says retirement is lame over to say the same thing he is still talk about he's still very driven. He feels it's very important that you need to have something that you can push forward that you can wake up every day on. He told me that he has a bunch of friends that you had sold out or retired decided they spend all the time playing golf or gardening. And then you speak to them a year later and they just aren't as sharp they're just not as vibrant they're just not as alive there's a certain kind of personality type. You know if you're listening to this you're probably one of them that you just you need something no matter what until death you need something to push forward something to focus on and to prove every single day and I think over it has that trait. In common with the other people that I've done in this I had dinner with Siri so I'm thinking of Charlie Munger he was still working until he died Sam Zell told me to my face I'll be doing deals till I die. He did that Brad Jacobs talk to him he's gonna be working till he dies John Mackey same thing retirement is lame retirement is fatal you need something to push forward and focus on and improve every single day. So before I go to review one to 10 number one mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it number two there is no ceiling on where you can push your profession. Number three don't be unequally yoked pick partners that have the same ambition as you number four read biographies know everything about the history of your industry number five have a profound sense of belief the world is malleable. There's always opportunity hiding in plain sight number seven by endurance we conquer number eight work 10% less optimize for the long term. Number nine surround yourself with people who will tell you the truth and number 10 retirement is lame. That's everything I got for you now hope you listen to the next episode I'll be going through Michael's excellent autobiography which I hope you obviously buy and read as well and then as I go through that biography I'll also reference other things that relate to the dinner that Michael and I had and that are in the book that is 381 down 1000 go and I'll talk to you again soon.
