--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's two ideas in this book that are repeated markets wallenberg junior prioritize investing in technology and surrounding yourself with great people is actually something that multiple generations of the wallenberg's would repeat. And i've been telling you that there's a lot of similarities i notice between people like steve jobs and jeff bezos and jensen wong last week and now it add markets wallenberg junior to that list as well. And it starts with jeff bezos is very first shareholder where jeff bezos emphasizes the importance of having the very best team he wrote setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon success you will heal here marcus wallenberg junior say something very similar to that. Just focus on talent is very similar to this quote that actually found that see jobs gave in an interview that very same year in nineteen ninety seven this is what steve said. Says i think i've consistently figured out who the really smart people are to hang around with you must find extraordinary people the key observation is that in most things in life the dynamic range between the average quality and the best quality is at most two to one. But in the field that i was interested in i noticed the dynamic range between what the average person could accomplish and what the best person could accomplish was fifty or a hundred to one given that you are well advised to go after the cream of the cream you want to build a team that pursues the a plus players. That is exactly what ramp did ramp has the most talented technical team in their industry becoming an engineer ramp is nearly impossible in the last twelve months they hired only point two three percent of the people that applied when you use ramp. I need you have the top tier technical talent and some of the best engineers working on your behalf twenty four seven to automate and improve all of your businesses financial operations and they do this all on a single platform that means the longer that you use ramp the more efficient your company becomes. In the end of that interview steve jobs added one thing he said a small team of a plus players can run circles around a giant team of b and c players from a customer's perspective what does a team of a plus players sound like it sounds like this customer view that i read. Which is that ramp is like having a teammate who you never need to check in on because they have it handled as you're about to hear marcus wallenberg junior pushes all of his companies to invest in technology that provide massive productivity gains if he was alive today. He would use ramp ramps website is incredible make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today that is ramp.com. One more thing i want to tell you before we jump into this episode is bestow a lot of my friends are using bestow to see all of their company accounts in one view so bestow helps you connect and control all of your business bank accounts from one dashboard i know the founder ben. I'm friends with them we spent a bunch of time together we've had dinner we've gone on walks and have offered to help him by introducing him to some of my other friends that i thought. Would benefit from using bestow so i called my friends he said listen david i will meet anyone that you want me to. But i will tell you i have to tell you that we say no to over 90% of the software that were pitched and yet a week later i hear back and he said that ben and bestow are great and that they signed up so i asked them. Can you please ask your team to explain the benefits that they get from bestow in their own words so i'm going to read this text message exchange where his team now in his own words are in their own words rather are telling. Me and you what the benefit is that they get from bestow and says it provides us the ability to view all of our bank accounts and loan accounts on one platform with a single sign on it makes it much easier to grant access to users in one place as opposed to 20 different banks so i text back what do they do before bestow and this is the response. We have 20 plus different bank logins across five accountants we literally use 21 banks so every bank has an account and alone that multiple people need access and views to just to log in and see everything would take hours and all the indifferent tabs. So if you have multiple businesses if you have multiple accounts go to bestow.com and schedule a demo with the founder ben and tell him david sent you that is bestow with a v bestow.com the link will also be down in the show notes and now let's get to the episode. Daniel act the founder of spotify was kind enough to invite me to come to sweden and since i was gonna go to sweden i figured i'd want to read and learn more about the most powerful family in sweden. It's the wallenberg family section a hundred and seventy year old family dynasty so the book don't talk to about today is called furthering a fortune marcus wallenberg swedish banker and industrialist and is written by all of osin. So marcus wallenberg junior was known as mw so that's i'm gonna refer to him throughout the entire conversation you are gonna have. I do want to jump right into his life i do think there's a few things i should like some background should give you about the wallenberg family cuz he's the third generation. And there's just a couple ideas that i think were laid like the foundation laid very early in the very early days of the family dynasty that mark is definitely built upon although i should see. He was fine with the responsibility of continuing the tradition and expanding the dynasty but he was much more of an in like an innovator than an administrator is somebody you know born wealthy. You might suspect that okay where rich were kinda just gonna maintain it he was not interested in that he was interested in technology innovation and drastically expanding the family fortune. There is a couple ideas that he never deviated from so there's a line in the very beginning of the book where. His actual uncle says long experience in this bank has taught us that we must almost exclusively put our trust in ourselves so the wallenbergs and this is mentioned multiple times throughout the book. They always had more liquidity than other banks and they did never wanted to put themselves or find themselves in a position where they had to rely on the kindness of outsiders i don't think you survive. And thrive really for a hundred and seventy years without being relatively conservative and having like this financial fortress remember this for later on because. When i am w is a young man his job one of the jobs in the bank and the family bank is the fact that he was handling all the loans for ever kruger which i covered all the back on episode three forty eight. Which was the biggest one of the biggest maybe the biggest financial scandal and financial collapse definitely in sweden's history but in economic history in general. And it is due to the conservative imprudent nature of the wallenbergs and what they taught you know the third generation that they wind up i'll tell you about this later but it's pretty crazy. They actually held more collateral from kruger than liabilities where a lot of other banks in the main competitor for the wallenberg family was actually his life and work was destroyed. Buy his association iver kruger so it's idea it's like a you have a ton of liquidity. More liquidity than the other banks and you don't want to put yourself in a position where you have to rely on the kindness of outsiders another thing that is in the book and i also got to meet was in sweden some people that had worked. With the wallenbergs for many many years and this came up over and over again the fact that the family rarely if ever sold. In many cases there's a bunch of problems in the businesses that they own the invest in. And they want to own these for decades in some cases over a century and what they found is like in time a lot of these problems can be solved or work themselves out. So says the bank did not content itself and when you hear the bank you really have to think of the family which again there was no difference between. The way mark is thought about it the way his father that's the family thought about it there's no difference between the bank and the family the business and the family the family is a business the business is a family. The bank did not content itself with writing off the lending losses but continue to maintain its interest in its debtor companies in an attempt to rescue them and at some future date recover as much of the bad debts as possible. So again i wanted to bring that up right up because they did this before and there was born and you'll see and does this and he actually carries on the tradition and really right rescues restructures combines a bunch of companies that the family on for an extremely long period of time. Before and w was born before he played a role in fact in the family business the family bank. There's multiple examples where they tell the people wallenberg family tells the employees are working for them that this is a family business it will be owned and controlled by the family. And again they repeat that we must endeavor to build up as large reserves as possible in the bank and in case you're listening to this you want to perpetuate a family dynasty i'm not gonna talk about the patriarch of the family. The founder of the family and see his name is a wallenberg but in case you're interested in petrifying dynasty you might wanna have lots of kids cuz a wallenberg had twenty one kids so i wanna jump right into. MW's life and you're gonna see traits that he had when he was a kid that he continued his entire life. They call there's a there's a funny line in the book really said that and w was a self confident five year old. He showed signs of being argumentative and strong willed from a very early age he had a great need for independence and control memories a kid is this whole life. And he was way more defiant than his siblings. I also said he often got his own way thanks to his charm and powers of persuasion so the family has such a set up a track for all the kids very early on which for the most part and w agrees to is again okay my my. My fate my destiny is to work in the family business and to perpetuate this dynasty but he's also gonna have input and really push back on his father even though he agree with his father. But i wanna give you an idea of like the kind of family we're dealing with where they really there was no ceiling on their ambition or what they thought they could do. So they actually the school after he does some brief military training and w is gonna go to school this school is the stockholm school of economics. And it's created by his family and the way i was thinking about this is when you when i went back and i read my highlights over and over again before i sit down and talk to you. And the second or third or fourth time i read this section i was oh you know what what's really happening the way i think about what's happening is the wallenberg family is starting this business school right. As a way to grow the entire pie and then take a percentage of that growing pie so what i mean by that growing the pie they're interested in making more business people so they make more businesses. If there's more businesses then they're going to own equity in some of those businesses and then have a relationship that the family banks can have a relationship with those businesses and. MW's uncle was the one that started it and he says it is for knowledge and training that will raise the members of the commercial sector from the level of shopkeeper shopkeepers and merchants and allow them to attain the position of respect to the occupying other countries trying to build a more. Sophisticated financial and business base inside sweden he said this is my first last and only wish with this whole idea was to promote merchant trade and so then i gotta bring up for the first time and won't be the last time. There's a bunch of very really important personal traits that i think and w hat it's mentioned you know when he was a kid teenager. When is eighty and still pushing the pace and out running many of the young people around him is this massive competitive drive this insane level of energy. He's constantly wanting to push things for he's addicted to technological change and investing in technology up until the day he dies. What you realize is that he the way he approached business he approached everything that he did and so one of his great loves really the one love he had in his life was business outside of. Business so was tennis to the point where you know he becomes a swedish doubles champion he plays at wimbledon for god's sake. But there's nothing there's nothing that he does that i would say that he doesn't like a recreational level he was not trying to be amateur so all he in fact he took. The same intensity applied to tennis he applied to his work and the same intensity applied to his work applied to his tennis he's very intense he's energetic he's disciplined he's physically fit and he's very consistent. So it talks about the fact that he would engage in intense physical training to attend it's involved physical training which made him conscious of the importance of taking regular exercise he never abandoned his habit of doing physical exercise every morning. Which set him up in good stead for the hectic pace he would keep throughout his life later in life he once subscribed himself as a sportsman who become a bank manager in his later days. An important explanation of successes in various fields was his intense competitive drive he love to compete and believe in competition as a principle for development and progress in business and in life. And so what my favorite parts of the book is the fact that there's all these letters in the book. Back and forth between mw and his father and you see the advice that his father has how mw kinda pushes back but one thing that he doesn't push back and i think this is actually good. If you're born into a situation like he is. He writes to his father at the time and w is about twenty one years old and he knew that he was gonna go into family bank right now he's gonna expand away past financing go he really thought of myself much worse like an industrialist he was much more interested in industry than it was finance. What do you write to his father something that's very interesting and i think there's a side idea here that you and i can benefit from he says i do grant you father that you are right about my career being determined. There is but one possibility to make progress to gain knowledge in other words to go forward so at the very end of the book there's a line in the book that says mw was not given to intro spectrum this is one of. Surprisingly like one of the most controversial observations that i have just about reading all these books. Many of the great founders once that they know what they want to do i would argue that they actually have very low levels of introspection to like almost no introspection and the reason that is important is because. Low introspection equals more action and you see the importance of action and moving forward with the way he ends that letter. These are very you know swedish people are very typically very reserved i was shocked at how many of the letters that mw is writing. And he just use exclamation points way more than i expected and he ends that letter to his father forward exclamation point and one thing that mw did not have to think about was that the family was something that his father taught him and that his father's father taught him was that the family in the bank were one in the same thing that's definitely how. Mw thought about it now once you're done with your military training now you finish with the stockholm school of economics. This is very fascinating is like okay i'm gonna map out you can't just come into the bank we're not gonna make give you a position of authority are you know put you right in the top. The way the family train the next generation i absolutely loved and i've seen this few times to they insisted that they have to learn from the ground up when i want to read to you if you listen to a few weeks ago when i covered. The two biographies of heady green was a single largest individual financier in the world time. The way that she wanted to train her son the next generation you know cuz heady green was fifth generation should be her family was rich for five generations before. She said okay i want you to learn the railroads and you're gonna learn it you know even i own a railroad i can make you see you anytime i want to present a time or no you're not gonna do that. You're gonna walk the goddamn tracks you're going to clearly gonna pull weeds and clean up you're gonna do every single job you're going to learn from the ground up. So what mw father does is first of all have phenomenal network just wait i read the the banks that he's gonna become a training app but they literally starts in the middle room he starts doing the lowest level possible success. His father had already started to plan the next step in his son's carefully mapped out career period periods of training with foreign banks the work was monotonous with all the manual duties that formed part of everyday banking at the time such as sorting checking counting and writing everything by hand. It provided with this is why he's doing this person it provided a basic insight to the workings of the financial system so mw father sending all over the world training and all these other banks see how they do it right. He's doing it so you learn from the ground up but he's also this is something that is repeated over and over again it's this maximum that i've said to you before relationships run the world. His father talks about the fact that personal contacts were actually even more important. Any even more important reason for training abroad and i think marcus wallenberg senior would agree with that. Over and over again he's talking about you need to prioritize the personal contacts when i read this great advice that he gives to his son again appearing on one of these letters to go back and forth between father and son throughout the book. It is necessary to behave in a way befitting a well-managed member of an established family when mw was about to leave london his father stressed how important it was. To clear out in a decent way you should pay visits are right to all those who shown you some kindness the most lasting relationships are created through paying attention and showing gratitude. You should take a couple of extra days doing that so it is when mw is in his early twenties that his dad sent him all over the world to study and to train. In a bunch of different banks now i'm gonna just give you this list is remarkable and it really does speak to the relationships at the walk wallenberg family cultivate and they did so over generations and he still do that. So he trains mw is gonna study and train in peak tae which is in switzerland this bank still exists two hundred twenty years after founding then he's gonna go move on to lazard. Are lizard maybe in london that was founded a hundred seventy six years ago in this bookshelf behind me i have a company history. Of the lizard bank or lazard bank that i'll eventually get to he then goes to brown brothers in new york and then credit leon a in paris. And one thing that would have been obvious to mw about the fact that relationships on the road during the training was the fact that lizard. They actually because of their long established relationships with the wallenberg family and the s e b which is the family bank. The market will receive was actually able to persuade them. Persuade the management of the bank to take his son on as a trainee which was totally against the banks procedures and principles. And so up until this point mw has kind of followed the path that his dad wanted him to embark on and then we see his dad finds out really early and you probably knew this from when he was kid. That he's going to exert his own will and so he writes to his dad hey guess what i met a woman i love her and i'm getting married. And so obviously if you're trying to perpetuate a family dynasty who your kids marry is extremely important so there's a series of letters that go back and forth. About this impending marriage and again i'm gonna cover to the chase mw now. And throughout his entire life is going to get what he wants he is not going to be allow himself to be controlled by anybody. But it is fascinating where you see his father really trying to counsel his son and just how he thinks. Like he's writing letters on about how he actually thinks about marriage that you know when you're in your early twenties you're not gonna have this perspective and so his father writes. Is the most natural thing in the world that young man takes a fancy to a young lady however it's important to decide whether or not his fancy shall be decisive for the rest of his life. When young one tends to believe in the one and only chance experience will modify this opinion. A marriage is not only based upon a fancy once the first outburst of emotion has passed a happy marriage requires a common outlook on life shared interest as well as mutual respect and tolerance. And then true to his personality when mw writes to his father about wanting to get married he said she just presented as a fait accompli like. This i'm making this decision it's going to happen when it does happening but again his father writes him in return he says. He's like i'm gonna prove you know of your decision but the approval the approvals not given without reservation so he says i approve your decision congratulate you wholeheartedly. However i do consider that a deferment is appropriate so that both parties have time for reflection i'm more than happy to see my boys getting married and continuing our esteemed family. Experience shows that is important not to make the wrong choice and be misled by one's feelings further reflection is recommended. And then marriage is not the only place he's gonna push back on his father again he's he was mw from time is young to time is old he's was way more interested in industry than he is finance so he's like okay i've studied these banks. I was sitting the banks anymore i want to go out and see companies building things. So his argument is father was our own bank is heavily engaged in industry it would therefore be better to spend a month and a half gaining experience in an iron foundry. An iron foundry a company in a forestry sector and electric company after that i could complete my bank training and then go to united states and visit more iron steel and electrical industries in the united states. MW felt it necessary to demonstrate a certain amount of independence towards his father after all should not mw himself ultimately take the decision on his own future. So the book talks a lot about what they call the wallenberg family sphere which i absolutely love that description. And in the most simple terms it is the bank the holding company which called investor a b which is founded nineteen sixteen is public and still exist in the state in fact it is the second largest company in sweden behind spotify. And then what i would call the family office which is really. A complex web of companies and holding companies that manage the family fortune you can actually see some of the structure on the family's website. It's wallenberg.com but it's important for me to point out that this is a very like oversimplified way to think about it because they're they have just a huge network of companies and you'll see this is as we continue to go through the book. Just how complicated get but i want to read the section to because this was what was taking place when mw starts his career in the family business it is important to remember that the banking business was only one of the fields of activity in which the wallenberg group was engaged. There are at least two other principal activities which came under the family umbrella the family was directly involved in industrial ownership. First of the rehabilitation of weaker companies in order to recover loan losses from their bank. Secondly in the development of new companies that the potential becoming valuable customers of the bank in the future much of their industrial activity was carried out through the holding company a b investor and the one that still exists as they. And it's subsidiaries backed by se be which is the family's bank back by se be capital resources and this is a key point here although dominated by the wallenberg family the investor group of companies was formally kept separate from the bank. So their bank and their main holding company is technically separate but they still control both a third line of business alongside the banking industrial operations was the management of the family's assets. Considerable growth was also achieved by the use of finance and holding companies that could carry on financial activities on a larger scale using techniques not normally found in banking that's why they have all these. Holding companies these companies were known as quote unquote associated companies which meant that they were formally independent of the bank. But we're still closely linked to it many of them were foreign companies enjoying tax and foreign exchange advantages and the reason i think it's so important to like try to simplify this the family sphere. The initial source of the family's wealth being the bank the way they grow the wealth being holding company and then you have all the private family office per se. The actual like the management of family's assets and i think those are three primary components of the sphere now. There's probably unlimited amount of companies within them like me give you a perfect example of why i think it'd be so difficult to actually put it put a. Actual price on how much wealth does this family have any and this goes for you know anything that's been combating for a long period of time. So later on the book they're like fighting with the eventual nazi government in germany over. One of their assets and this to me this is like the perfect example just how complicated and how widespread their family sphere went so the wallenberg family. Owns a plantation in ecuador that plantation in ecuador is run by a german limited liability company. But the main the principal owner and the main shareholders is the wallenberg family in sweden so an ecuadorian plantation run by germans owned by sweets. It's a 300 pages of this book when you're reading about all these different companies i mean mw is gonna sit. He's on 80 different boards he's like the chairman of more like 30 something companies i think we'll get a little bit but the note i left myself when i got to the sections like how many companies that they own. Almost impossible to know and so that brings to two main reoccurring themes is the fact that mw wants control and he's has an older brother. And there's gonna be a lifelong tension with his brother in fact he said later on that whenever he decided anything. In his brother's absence his brother within come to the next meeting and try to change it immediately so there's gonna be a bunch conflict. Between those two for control throughout their entire lives and w mw is the one that winds up winning that battle the second thing that. I something that we occurs over and over again in the story in his life is the fact that he was extremely interested in technology again he did not view himself. He was not an administrator he was an innovator that's. What's really important to him he stressed in his talks and his management companies the importance of technology says i imagine that economics quite simply means making use of technology. It is always possible to build a new industries on the basis of inventions we can only express the hope that we shall see new epoch making inventions emanating from sweden that will be the benefit of the world. And then his next sentence is why that was important to him and his family if that comes about we may rest assured that the necessary capital for their exportation. Would be made available with in sweden from the wallenberg family and from the wallenberg family bank. So let me actually give you a practical example of this of the idea of moving into a place where there's technological headwinds okay. And this idea that i mentioned earlier that they rarely if ever sell and they wind up just being having a very long term point of view. And a lot of the problems that they have inside companies because they never sell they're able to work through given enough time and so. This is really a family case study for how problems should be handled inside of their companies. And one of the most surprising things that i learned from this book is they really have tried to avoid letting bad investments die there's a you know some people believe that. You know spend all your time on the big winners kind of cut your losses there's really no wrong way for this just depends on what you want to do. But they the wallenberg family they spent a ton of time not letting their bad investments die and because they have such as long term horizon. They're able to wait out for better times and opportunities so this company called atlas and says perhaps the best example of the perseverance of the wallenbergs with regard to its industrial investments. Within the family this case is traditionally been regarded as a model of how industrial problems should be handled this is where mw rapidly learn practical crisis management under the supervision of his father. Atlas was a company that had been founded in eighteen seventy three by the patriarch of the family this is founded by a wallenberg in eighteen seventy three the reason you started the companies cuz in eighteen seventy three. The tech the main technology of his day was the real words right so they start atlas for the purpose of producing equipment for a network of railways. I'm gonna pause there there's another maxim that jumps out when you study this family and that's don't let the money escape. So if you're gonna start a phone if a wallenberg any wallenberg started a company who do you think is going to be that company's bank. S. e. b. was the atlas is bank atlas became the largest mechanical engineering company in sweden taking up a lot of the banks management time and entry as well as a disproportionate share of its loan portfolio. The company's first crisis curd after the eighteen seventies with the decline of the railway industry. So what do they do during the eighteen eighties and eighteen nineties atlas was restructured to separate time so this idea of restructuring consolidating and combining is something that the wallenberg's do over and over again remember they're not going to sell. So they they wind up changing from producing equipment for railroads into the manufacturing of air operated tools and compressors. So around the time that atlas switches from railroad equipment to pneumatic air compressor tools okay marcus wallenberg senior and i'll use dad. They found the wallenbergs found companies to make investments they buy companies they start companies. He founded a company called a b diesels the idea was hey we're gonna manufacture engines based on rudolph diesels patent right what they do is a hey we're going to actually consolidate atlas into a b diesel. So we're gonna combine the companies that combined company does well for a few years in large part because this is during world war one and there's a huge demand for the products after the war ends there's a depression in sweden that hits both companies very hard. So keep in mind this is fifty years after the founding of atlas there's still control the company they were thinking okay maybe we need to close down the business completely they decide not to do that they decide. To restructure it and then they have to lay off a bunch of workers to go down from about nine hundred employees down to three hundred they restructure the company they write down the shares they still have full ownership and control. So it says the family was again prepared to wait for better times that is a very important line. Because they have control and because they have financial resources and the long term they have a long term perspective now is that they can wait for better times now what they realize is a. Are compressor and air compressed tools division shows the greatest potential for growth and it's being pulled down by this diesel diesel engine division. And so another thing that you see the wallenbergs do over and over again is that's fine we're not gonna sell the company we're just gonna drop that bad business line. And then we're gonna find a market that provides tailwinds and this is what happens the profits came instead from air operated tools and compressors a market sector that appeared to be expanding before the decade had ended. Diesel engine manufacturing had been closed down and the march towards a position for the company as a world leader in the area of pneumatic technology had been initiated by investing in the cutting edge of technology and the international marketplace and W chose a direction that would in the future. Be central to his industrial philosophy. Okay moving on to another idea that the wallenberg family repeats over and over again the importance of picking who you associate with carefully I'm gonna start with an example somebody that did not do this and it winds up destroying this guy's life and work this is the section on ever Kruger. Says even Kruger became very closely associated with Oscar ride back who had headed this other bank I'm not even gonna try to pronounce since 1917 and who was the only person who could really compete with Marcus Wallenberg senior for the title of Sweden's leading banker during the 1920s. Can the reason to speak to the importance of picking who you associate with carefully you are Kruger is going to destroy this guy's life and work the exact opposite is going to happen to the wallenberg family mentioned earlier that mw manage the ivar. You are Kruger financial disaster extremely well the family bank had refused to loan Kruger more money before his empire collapsed and when it did collapse the bank actually had more collateral than liabilities. I do think you are Kruger is very important to study but i didn't have so don't have a question learning more listen to episode three forty eight. Which is about this book called the match king you are Kruger the financial genius behind a century of wall street scandals and i think in more ways than one. The ever Kruger collapse actually demonstrates a shrewdness of the way the wallenbergs operated their business so not only were they not taken down or destroyed by them they actually as a result of the collapse of the program higher the wallenberg group was drastically expand i'll just give you one example of this. At the time where kruger dies some people think of suicide some people think he was murdered. Ericsson was a very very precarious situation because kruger was a majority shareholder in Ericsson. And this again combines with another idea that the wallenberg has this extreme long term outlook and the way the wallenberg family operates in this really long term way they actually still control. This company Ericsson a hundred years later Ericsson is jointly controlled by the wallenbergs and this other bank called handles bacon. And they both acquired their voting strong a shares and thus control of Ericsson after the fall of Kruger and so before i move on introduce this idea that they don't let the money escape which is very fat was very fascinating to me. What about the notes from the book down record and i wanna just give you an update on where the wallenberg family is today says the wallenberg family is one of sweden's most prominent business dynasties. Controlling a significant sphere there's a word again significant sphere of influence in swedish and nordic businesses do their investment companies and foundations. The core of their business empire centers around investor a b this is what i mentioned earlier it's the second most valuable. Public company in sweden right now behind spotify so this is the way they describe investor a b is their main investment company founded in nineteen sixteen. Which holds large ownership stakes in major swedish multinational companies like Ericsson in telecommunications atlas and industrial equipment a bb in engineering. AstraZeneca and pharmaceuticals and seb and banking. The wallenberg are known for their long term investment approach and active ownership style often placing family members or trusted associates on the boards of companies that they invest in they emphasize substance over appearance and long term value creation over short term gains i'm gonna read one more thing for the book. Which is just blew my mind when i started reading while marcus wallenberg junior before i read his biography. MW impact on swedish industry was so substantial that during the nineteen seventies wallenberg family businesses employed about forty percent. Single family and put about forty percent of sweden's industrial workforce and represented forty percent of the total worth of the stock market in sweden. Now i wanted to read that to you because i think this idea and again i took this idea from the book and just compress it down to a maximum for you and i don't let the money escape is one way they do this so your preferred partner right you have this network of companies who knows the cow. Even if they're separately structures there you know heavily controlled by one family and people that they trust it's your preferred partner for every single thing should be should be inside the wallenberg sphere so they take control of Ericsson okay. They wind up going to the government of finland. And the family bank s e b says hey we are going to loan you government of finland four million dollars from our bank. So you can then spend that money that came from our bank and give it to Ericsson so they can expand your network. Your telecommunications network and then Ericsson you're going to have an agreement with s e b that we get at least thirty seven point five percent of all of your banking business. Don't let the money escape their associated companies almost always had to use the family bank now without a doubt since this is the biography of Marcus Wallenberg jr of mw right. He's been the main character the supporting character the most other important character in this book is without a doubt his father and his father's life motto. Actually becomes the family's motto and is still to this day it's on their website over and over again sauce on this book. It translates from latin it is to be not to seem and one way he described it to his sons cuz he's about to pass away and we're gonna get into really how his sons are now writing back. To each other to to their friends and to their associates about the impact that their father had in their lives but the way he described it to his son's was it was the importance of being sincere and true to oneself. So this part is absolutely incredible read the whole thing i'm gonna give you my outline my notes before you number one admiration for his father number two the importance of innovating and creating something new. Number three his idea that we need to be epoch makers number four the traits that mw most admired from his father and number five the importance of again this is repeated they just have a handful of ideas that they repeat over and over again like everybody else. Surround yourself with great people this is something the wallenberg's repeats and now mw. Is writing right after the death of his father he said you probably know better than most people what a wonderful father friend comrade and mentor he was in the strength of the ties with which we developed with him. He has left a great void but his spirit is so strong that it will live on forever among many of us what mw inherited from his father and turn to his own advantage was the ability to create something new. This is now how mw thought about this for the sake of civilization i sincerely hope that the epoch of bold and constructive innovation has not come to an end with the passing away of my father innovation goes on constantly. And is stronger than any regulation the fact that he was often seen as the soul of an epoch or regarded as an epoch maker was probably due to his unusual qualities should other men of the same caliber emerge I believe they will also be seen as epoch makers. MW continue to describe his father he was extremely versatile he had a phenomenal memory and was very knowledgeable in all kinds of sciences and literature enjoyed music and new about different technologies and he mastered languages as well there's always exclamation points again. I'm really surprised by these very reserved sweets how often mw use exclamation points I do the same so I love it. He was very interested in history and would tell stories about his various companies and about the difficulties he encountered he was talented first of all in terms of wisdom and intelligence but he also had great judgment industriousness energy. Any also good health and had a sense of responsibility really the reason i'm reading this to you because he's describing his father. But now that I know the full arc of mw's life you could use the same description of him as well he often used to say I find it difficult not to intervene when I see things going wrong and one thing I think is very important. Is that he was very good at picking good collaborators and so with the passing of his father this is not gonna surprise you based on the personality and everything you and I've discussed up to this point he's gonna become and it was gonna become the most prominent and powerful person inside the family even though he's the second son. That is why the book is called furthering a fortune and the way he furthers the wallenberg family fortunes because he had this obsession not with finance but with industry and i'm shocked. How much of the book is covering the restructuring reviving and combining of all of the different companies that they quote quote invest in but really there like I don't think of them as investors they are very much. Like operators almost like co-founders in a lot of these cases are on the board they wield a hell of a lot of influence and control and so mw's talking about the fact that you know they if you own something for a long period of time it's given is gonna have ups and downs. And he talks about their approach to fixing these ailing company so he says first the bank's management examines the company's position and they identify where the true losses lay. Then with the help of a very realistic approach a judgment has to be made as to whether the company could be able to succeed if it was given a fresh start sometimes that is combining company sometimes that's shedding. Business units that were not performing as well sometimes it means writing it down and recapitalizing it but then he says then the company's bank. Right this is what i mean about the don't let the money escape the company's bank was often become involved in a long term basis. And in the interaction interaction between the family bank and the company's management is what mw says over and over again the personal element of the relationships was the greatest importance he goes back on. Why relationships so important let's say we have a an ailing company we've recapitalized it with combined we got new management we did where we can. Now what happened now what we do next to make it grow the management of the bank which you can think of as the family right often committed itself to trying to secure markets meaning customers. Further resurgent company do judicious use of our contacts. And so here's a description of some of the ways that mw implements and exerts his influence again they believe it wallenberg's believe and then do you believe in long term and active investment. When he became the managing director of the bank he was able to mobilize all of its resources he established a system of active ownership what does that mean this we did. He hired a staff function for the gathering of information. Economist technicians were recruited a legal department employing professional lawyers set up. And files on potential managers were kept and so on so he's helping them recruit as well. When you go through this whole section i was trying to summarize all the different things that he was doing here is a great minute this guy sets up a business inside of a business which is the bank. That is in the business of managing businesses that's really what he did that is not a short term and passive investor and then he goes about marshaling his leadership and his storytelling abilities because. Him his brother have again they have this like dynamic tension over and over again his brother is the administrator he is the innovator and so there is a family motto that they would also have. Is to shift from the old to that which is coming which we saw remember go back to the case study on atlas right you have this. This company founded by a wallenberg in eighteen seventies that they then manage and successfully shift from the old which is the railways all the way to diesel engines all the way to being the leading company and you know new madic and and air compression. Tools and so he's writing a letter to his brother and this is what he says this is he's expressing his views on enterprise and development. I said to sell a railway in order to buy into airlines in other words to shift from the old to that which is coming. Which has been the model for the business activities of early generations of our family is the only tradition worth caring for in which our ancestors would like to see us maintain. MW was not shy it was a very direct person he was not shy about saying that he thought he was better suited to take care of the family's industrial traditions. We are expanding not just from a bank we have all kinds of businesses these businesses are growing rapidly this is in between pre and post world war one and pre and post world war two you have these massive. Economic explosions and MW is constantly criticizing he says his brother is too passive he's more of an administrator than an innovator there was without a doubt a difference in their temperaments. MW was impatient curious about technology and on tiring in his following up on business matters whereas Jacob was often analytical to analytical and MW's opinion. Frequently delaying decisions and giving free arraying to executive managers and the reason I think this part so important I wanted to bring out to not just to talk about the differences personality between the two brothers. What is very obvious think about the description of a five year old and W that you and I talked about now you know he's forty years old forty five years old where we're on the story. He's doing and doing exactly what I feel Charlie Munger would tell him to do which is you need to follow your natural drift. And you see his natural drift manifest there's personalities actions you also see when he plays golf I love this story when MW played around a golf he would aim straight for the green even if the course were difficult and curving Jacob preferred to hit two safe strokes. Never member and W's father is dead go back to the advice that he had a son hey you're young you're excited you met this you know sexy lady you have all these feelings you know you gotta have a calm head. His father's passed away and W gets a divorce and then he does one of the two of the craziest things I've ever read about and one indication that his first wife. And him we're not going to last very long is because one of her favorite one of his first wife's favorite expressions to repeat is there's more to life than business. Not for MW now here's two crazy things first of all MW is going to marry or steal the wife. Of the king's nephew okay this goes back remember he was having a really hard time and I mean hard time it was I guess when I'm trying. He would not even refuse like compromise for like conventions sake and his dad you see his dad earlier trying to like counts the sun through letters and conversations. You know you're certain things are expected of your kind of acting like you know what more will for a little while then than expected so. MW goes on a transatlantic cruise as a bunch of people leaving from from Sweden they're going to all going to a wedding in America and on this cruise. When his wife is pregnant with their third child by the way who she stays back in Sweden. He meets this woman this is going to want to being his new wife is my wife is going to be Marianne Bernadotte who knows if I pronounce that correctly at the time Marianne is married to count Carl. Bernadotte count Carl is the son of Prince Oscar who is the brother of King Gustaf V. So despite the fact that they're both married right they went up falling in love and it says they prepared to dissolve their marriages quickly in order to unite. And keep in mind divorce his divorce was still unusual men members of the establishment if divorce was frowned upon by the Wallenberg family which it definitely was it was a positive scandal. For the Bernadotte family and member of the royal family had been abandoned by his wife. And it gets even more awkward MW used to play tennis with the king and now you have just stolen the wife of the king's nephew. Needless to say I got a good chuckle out of this next sentence it took some time before MW and his new wife were invited to the royal palace for dinner. That is the first wild thing that he does in his personal life here is the second it is very highly likely that MW winds up setting up the next marriage for his first wife because. MW first wife marries a close associate of the Wallenberg family his ex wife marries this guy named Charles Hambrough Charles Hambrough is a member of a well known family of bankers the Wallenberg bank owned shares in the Hambrough's bank. And MW and Charles knew each other and W children would later say jokingly or not that their father had probably arranged his wife's second marriage. And I think the thing that ties all this together is really just like MW gets what MW wants and so he winds up wrestling control. Of the family bank from his brother and every single thing that he wants to control whether it's the family's industrial holding company the bank anytime he wants to control something he winds up getting control of it so from here on in for the rest of his life he's gonna push the pace. Up until his 80s he works until he he dies and in fact he's like training all the young people around him and they just cannot believe the amount of energy. This guy has so i want to go over the very unique way because he really has no regard for convention. Are just continuing down a path just because somebody else in his family beforehand continued on that path in everything he does he inject some kind of new idea so takes over. The management of the family bank any institution thing called he calls morning prayers so he gathers his top people and each of them would give an account of their respective areas responsibility report major individual transactions and exchange general information in this way. MW could keep abreast of developments within the bank and be at the center of the flow of information so it's kind of like an analog low tech way if you listen to the Jensen Wong episode I did last week. Where both MW and Jensen and a lot of history such words they want unimpeded information and a lot of it and so Jensen has this idea was like hey every single person the company you're gonna write writing once a week. This top five things this T5 T email right top five things you're gonna put in bullet points I'm gonna you know read hundreds of them every week and I'm gonna have this unimpeded flow of information. MW analog version of that is I'm gonna gather all my people together and every real quick in many cases they mentioned the fact that these meetings go really fast like fifteen minutes. I'm gonna get this unimpeded information on a daily basis from the people in my company another thing that was very unusual given the industry that they're in. And how reserved the family was and W is the first person he actually starts advertising the banks services publicly because he wants to grow. And so it says in the early in the early nineteen fifties the bank which normally took a low profile with the media advertise that it was at the service of private enterprise. He starts making the bank invest heavily in technology and so in technology their day they have these punch card machines. So he buys a bunch of punch card machines and then all and make sure that all accounting transactions inside of the bank have to be no longer done by hand they have to be done on the technology of their day which is the punch card machines right. So this result all accounting transactions were transferred to punch cards which led to a dramatic increase in efficiency productivity doubled. Twice as many transactions were carried out by a work first work force that only had increased from four hundred twenty five employees to five hundred and fifty so they add you know hundred twenty five employees but they do double amount of work because of. I'm W's insistence that you need to invest in technology because we want to push these massive increases in productivity that technology enables. And so remember he wrestled control of the family bank from his older brother and we're gonna get a lot more details on how he decided to run his business. There's a lot of differences between his brother Jacob and him but there's also gonna be a lot of parallels when i got to this section i thought a lot about Steve jobs. And Jensen Wong so says MW was a highly visible driving force in the bank Jacob had adopted a low profile the employees did not see much of him and W had a different way of communicating with the staff he got to know. Everybody so i would say he's MW is a big proponent of management by walking around he locked he like to walk around the office asking what the different employees were doing the pace of the work in the bank increased. MW would express his dissatisfaction with somebody in front of other people so remember just like Jensen was a big proponent of public criticism. Talk about the fact that you should criticize publicly because it should be a learning experience for the entire company if you pretty criticized privately only you and that individual employee actually learn the lesson. And Jensen was optimizing just like MW is optimizing for the overall learning of the entire company. MW would become irritated and loses temper but there was a often a sound intention behind his outburst he considered it useful for others to understand what it meant to work for him that's my suggestion as well. Not keeping him informed of what was going on was a mortal sin that reminds me of Jensen as well. It was not up to the subordinate to judge what needed to be reported Jensen almost says that exact same thing it's spooky how similar this is. MW himself wanted detailed information even on apparently trivial matters he wanted to draw the conclusions himself reports containing the writers own reflections he would call half chewed food now. I weird thought the came my when i got to this section. Because this is his money Steve jobs would insist on improving every single ad. That apple did before went out and so the people that made the ads in the meetings with jobs they would like put the ad in front of them and they try to tell my story and jobs to tell me shut up. Take are you gonna be there you know when I see this billboard when I'm having coffee on a Sunday morning and sing this apple ad in newspaper and they're like no exactly so be quiet I want to be able to judge. They draw the conclusions myself another side of MW leadership style was that once he had told someone off he would quickly let the matter pass it not linger. Now one striking way that MW deviated from both Steve jobs and Jensen you know Steve focus on running apple the whole time Jensen focus on running Nvidia. The whole time MW was the chairman of the board for 33 separate companies and on the board of another 80 companies. His style I would say is much more in line with what Sam zell said where he set up his all of his companies and everything he was in Sam said I am the chairman of everything and the CEO of nothing. There's a couple other things I just made a list because you know they reaper over and over again and so I just made a list of how I think about MW's entrepreneur philosophy. Okay number one he wants to invest in technology number two he wants decisive influence over the company he is working on are investing in number three he's going to impatiently push things forward constantly. Which leads to number four which seems paradoxical and the paradox is MW short term impatience combined with the long term perseverance of the Wallenberg family in their industrial matters the list continues number five the quality of the people's most important fact let me interrupt the list I want to read the section to get back to my list when judging companies and W considered that the capacity of its top people was generally the most important ingredient. He therefore chose executive managers with great care he kept himself well informed about new names drove his managers extremely hard and moved others aside if they were not up to the task those of his own generation who had allied themselves closely with him earlier. We're gradually moved to one side in favor of new blood he demanded unlimited work and loyalty from his managing directors and all of his industrial companies number five the quality of the people's most important number six he believed in driving people hard number seven he wanted new blood and number eight he had tons of expansive energy for new initiatives. And number nine is one of his favorite things that he would repeat he said ownership without presence rots ownership without presence rots what does he mean go in person be seen be prepared let me just give you a quick example of this is also important him to study industrial operations at first hand to forge contacts with on site personnel and to be visible. He like to prepare himself well before his visits and like to surprise people with unexpected questions often quite detailed ones the managing director on the site could never feel absolutely safe which of course was mw's intention. Here's what a meeting with mw was like from the perspective of one of his company's directors is gonna remind you again sam zell jay pritzker bernardo no they have all been described in a similar way that. MW is gonna be described from one of his directors monthly reports sales statistics and minutes from meetings were reviewed and w had a unique talent. For putting his finger on the exact figure or point which you had not analyzed sufficiently are about what you did not know all the answers the outstanding ability to possess to analyze a report quickly. What's certainly acquired do a life long experience of scrutinizing statistical information and annual reports he had a unique ability. I'm quickly putting his finger on the week points and asking difficult questions again sam zell jay pritzker bernardo no have all been described in that exact same way now this is not to say. That a lot of as you can imagine this kind of domineering personalities very difficult personality. There's gonna be a lot of people that love him and there's gonna be loyal to him and a lot of people that don't in fact one of his main directors and one of the holding companies actually described. MW as both a great man and a small one this part. I thought was a great description so I'm gonna just read the entire thing to you and I think it really gives us a sense of you know who mw was. His greatness was incontestable and worthy of all of our admiration it was based on a deep sense of responsibility for sweden as a country and in particular for the swedish economy. He spent all of his expertise energies and time on the task of developing and in many cases rescuing companies this was his life. Everything and everybody was subordinated to his mission in life. What do I mean then by saying that he was a small man in certain respects I certainly do not exaggerate when I say that he was notorious for striking terror into the hearts of many of his direct and indirect subordinates. He could be merciless even relatively trivial issues could cause dreadful outbursts of anger. It is mainly this merciless side of him that I have in mind when I speak about being a little man a thoroughly great and just person does not treat his fellow human beings like that. And I want to pause there before I go into the greatest tragedy of mw's life. I really thought about this because I told you for instance like very negative inner monologue and I want to reason one of the reasons I work by myself is I don't want to express like I don't want to talk to other people the way I talk to myself. And if you were at the reason I thought about this because like if you would ask Charlie monger and I did I got to talk to Charlie monger about this for he died like who he thought the greatest entrepreneur of all time was and he would say Rockefeller. And one of the most fascinating things about our first obviously the people you and I study together a lot of them are you know. Ruthless and there's a bunch of examples of them being incredibly harsh and mean and to people around them. Within on the that doesn't one end of the spectrum but I would I you know I've said before it's not a prerequisite to success you have literally the guy that monger says the best ever do it and people worked for him for decades I said they know they. They never heard him raises voice they never heard him say an unkind word now of course I'm not. Naive like Rockefeller's competitors would not describe him you know as a as a nice person with etiquette manners but as I get older and I'm exposed to other people that are you know wildly successful and also not assholes. I think etiquette and manners. They become more important admirable. To me and maybe because I see that's like a area in my own life where have like vast room for improvement and so it's almost like aspirational but I don't. Yeah I don't want to get to my life and be described by people like that that say like he was a small person a little man. Yeah I you know I want to rip through these ideas in a fast manner I want to be respectful your time but I do think pausing there. Is really important just what how do we want to be described after we're gone. And then I'm not gonna say it's the cause for for for what happens next which is by far the greatest tragedy in mws life but it is interesting that it follows in the book like this so. Mark junior which is. MW grown son this is towards the end of mws life is price seventy years old and this occurs mark juniors obviously being. He's he's running parts of the company the family business he's being trained he is mw successor. And he makes a mistake and says mark junior had been given a interview. And he was asked like why did the wallenberg start building this new pulp factory in germany without yet having received permission from the authorities and he had answered honestly but imprudently. That it was preferable to be prosecuted for breaking environmental laws that to paying large damages for breach of contract to a german buyer of pulp. And so his reply aroused a great deal of attention and was reported throughout the press he could expect to receive some sharp comments from mw. Sure enough at the board meeting in the afternoon he was severely reprimanded by his father his father then closes the meeting. And then we then leave sweden to fly to london the next morning wakes up gets an alarming report that mark junior had not appeared at his schedule friday morning meetings. Nor did he spend the night at his house so mw flies back to sweden. When he gets back in stockholm he is met by somebody that works with them and tells and that person tells mw the dreadful news that his son killed himself. And w's son. Went into the forest that afternoon. And shot himself and the book describes the days after this happens i don't i don't have words for this. Says mw did not outwardly reveal any sorrow or possible remorse he told one family member remember that in a crisis we wallenberg's are ice cold. There's another interview in the book given it says i remember i was standing talking with mw at mark juniors funeral. And then one of the saddest lines in the book is about marks son husky who is mw's. Grandson and it says mw took care of husky the ties between them reflected the fact that it was a father who had left his family. And then he says he was the only one who could have left his family. And so for the remaining 10 to 12 years of mw's life he's spending the time trying to train the generation and the next generation after him. For this perpetuation of this family dynasty i think this is a fitting way to close on mw's life he passes away in these 82. And then he says he was the only one who could have left his family. And then he says he was the only one who could have left his family. For this perpetuation of this family dynasty i think this is a fitting way to close on mw's life he passes away in these 82. Says a straightforward and simple theme rammed throughout mw's life. He had accepted responsibility early on for taking over the family's heritage and traditions from his parents with almost religious fervor. His father preached to him about the importance of fulfilling this duty. In spite of crises, conflicts and shifting political winds, mw carried out his task with remarkable consistency and strength. Mw's whole life was colored by this overwhelming task. Anything else would have been a betrayal of his destiny. And that is where i'll leave it for the full story. Highly recommend buying the book.
