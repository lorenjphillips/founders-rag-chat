Here's something exciting for you. I am doing a live podcast next Monday, September 16 in New York City with my friend Patrick from invest like the best it is free because of the good people. My friends at ramp it is going to be a ramps headquarters in Manhattan. If you live in New York, you want to 10 or if you want to hop on a plane for that matter and fly to New York on short notice next week, there is a link down below on your podcast player. And you can use that link to register to attend. You got to move fast spaces very very limited. I'm very grateful to the founders of ramp for offering to do this to offering to make it free for all one thing that's really important to the founders of ramp who become good friends and I spent a lot of time with it's also important to me. It's also important to Nick and Zach and the crazy story that you're about to hear and that is this relentless dedication to quality as you're about to find out Nick sleep and his partner Zach have this cult like following this mystique about them. Not only do they have this phenomenal performance in the very unique and maverick way they built their fund and their partnership a partnership that made their investors about 2 billion dollars in profit in 10 years but Nick and Zach's organizing principle was around caring intensely about the quality of your actions and decisions. And so they made very few but heavily concentrated bets on what they thought were the highest quality businesses run by the highest quality founders and in this book Nick and Zach talk about the qualities that these world class founders have and if you've been listening to founders for a while now this is not going to come as a surprise for you they said these for middly efficient companies kept costs low at one point they have about 70% of their net worth tied up in Amazon they talk about what they love about one of the things about Bezos is that Jeff Bezos was ruthlessly efficient about controlling costs Nick and Zach's partnership started before founders existed and ended before founders existed and yet it is through their relentless study of the history of entrepreneurship that they arrived at the exact same conclusion it's exactly what Andrew Carnegie said he'd repeat the mantra over and over again that profits and prices are cyclical they're subject to any number of transient forces on the marketplace costs however could be strictly controlled and in Andrew Carnegie's view any savings achieved in the cost were permanent and it is because he believed that there's a line in Andrew Carnegie's biography that says cost control became an obsession the reason I partner with ramp is because ramp shares that obsession the reason ramp exists is to give you everything you need to control your spend ramp gives you everything you need to control your cost and gives you easy to use corporate cards for your entire team automated expense reporting and cost control I've been spending a lot of time with their CTO and co-founder and a good friend of mine Kareem and their heads of AI the technical talent inside of ramp which I'll tell you more about in the upcoming weeks is incredible when you become a ramp customer that means you have these mad scientist and math and technical geniuses working 24 hours a day building products that help you run an efficient organization check out ramps website I think it's incredible make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business control costs that is ramp.com Nick sleep wanted to stay in Edinburgh so he looked around to see what Edinburgh was good at and he learned that Edinburgh had a reputation for fun management so he read an obscure book titled investment trust explained to help him figure out what the investing business was all about he came away intrigued he said I like the sense of it being an intellectual investigation. So sleep landed a job as a trainee investment analyst at a small Scottish fund company he was not abundantly qualified for the job at college he had studied geology and then switched to geography his employment history offered no evidence that he was going to be good for a career in finance he had worked in a department store at an IT firm and had been a sponsored windsurfer. Still he had stumbled into a field that perfectly suited his idiosyncratic mind like all of the best investors sleep views the world from an unusual angle sleep commented on this saying all the way back in high school he says I got comfortable with being different from everyone else early on I was happy being outside the group. When sleep was about 20 he read the book Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance an inquiry into values it was a strange but brilliant meditation on what it means to lead a life dedicated to quality the book exalts people who care so intensely about the quality of their actions and decisions that even the most mundane work becomes a spiritual exercise. For the author motorcycle maintenance provides an ideal metaphor for how to live and work in a transcendent way the real cycle you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The books approach to life resonated deeply with sleep and shape the type of investor he would become this is how Nick sleep described the books enduring impact on him you really want to do everything with quality as that is where the satisfaction and peace is. But what does this mean when it comes to investing in 2001 sleep and his friend Kai's Zach Zacharia created a fund called the nomad investment partnership which they viewed as a laboratory test for how to invest think and behave in the most high quality way. Sleep wrote eloquent and amusing letters to shareholders which have been sent to me many times over the years and people have asked requested they do an episode on them which will be the next episode after this one. And there was a stunning outcome of this high minded experiments over about 14 years they went up 10 X in the money in 2014 sleep and Zach returned their shareholder money and retired as fund managers at the ripe old age of 45. Since then they've managed their own money with equally striking success approximately tripling their wealth in the first five years of retirement. Sleep with characteristic indifference to conventional opinion invested almost all of his fortune in just three stocks at times he and Zach had as much as 70% of their money in a single stock. And then it was a few of the traits of other investors admire about them their complete independence the clarity of their thinking the very deep research and the very high concentration that they have. And then of course their mystique Nick and Zach have always flown under the radar they had minimal interest in marketing their fun and even less in self promotion as a result their story has never been told. But over the last few years I've interviewed Nick sleep on multiple occasions I spent an afternoon with him and Zach at their office in London it was there that they reflected on what they called their adventures in capitalism. That was an extra the book and we talked about today which is Richard wiser happier how the world's greatest investors win in markets and life and is written by William green and actually i'm going to focus on a single chapter chapter six in this excellent book and as a matter of fact. Well the chapter is called Nick and Zach's excellent adventure a radically unconventional investment partnership reveals that the richest rewards go to those who resist the lure of instant gratification in fact at the very end of Nick sleeps. Show her letters I guess partnership letters is more accurate he recommends reading this book he says to those who wish to read more you can do so in William greens book Richard wiser happier William has written the kind of book that we would have loved to written we are sure you will enjoy the read. And I definitely agree I think William green does this fantastic job of giving us an overview of exactly how they built this investment partnership and I think covering this first and then next week you and I discussing. The ideas that are actually next sleeps partnership letters is the perfect sequence so let's go ahead and jump into a little background on both Nick and Zach. So Zach was born in Iraq in nineteen sixty nine he says he was born into a relatively privileged family his father worked at the Iraqi central bank and his mother lectured at the University of Baghdad three years later. Zach describes them having to flee the country by saying we were purged. They had to flee Iraq leave everything behind and take refuge in the United Kingdom his dad builds the family back up by starting a successful business that exports machinery back into Iraq. By the time Zach is leaving home to go to school he goes to he's going to go to Cambridge to study mathematics his dad goes bankrupt. He goes bankrupt not to his main business he actually goes bankrupt because he was speculating in the stock market with borrowed money this is the way Zach describes I think is really important. My father had made his money on things he understood and lost them on things he didn't understand. And so on every single episode before I sit down to talk to you I go over my notes and highlights multiple multiple multiple times and the last time I went over them because now. I'm reading notes and highlights I know how the story ends and this part becomes even more important because he says you know my father made his money on things he understood. And lost it on things he didn't understand Nick and Zach a cornerstone to their partnership I would say is the fact that Nick and Zach develop a deep understanding they make their money on things they understand deeply. So after graduating from Cambridge Zach heads to Hong Kong he gets a job as an equity analyst. This doesn't last long because it turns out his boss was crooked his boss was being fired and then fined millions of dollars and then as a result Zach was laid off. And so Zach was telling William Green about like how desperate this part of his life was that he would call all his friends apply to any job say he would literally do anything. And there's a recurring theme when you read a lot of biographies the way I would summarize this is that opportunity is a strange beast it frequently appears after a loss. The only job he can get is a job he doesn't want and that job is as a sell side analyst specializing Asian stocks at Deutsche Bank. Zach describes this part of his life as absolute hell he said I did it for four years and it was absolute hell I was not being someone who is easily sold to I couldn't sell to anyone but there was one consolation is because of this job that he meets Nick sleep. Opportunity is a strange beast it frequently appears after a loss or what is perceived as a loss a temporary loss. So during the same time that Nick left that small Scottish fund he went and got a job at Sun Life of Canada which was this gigantic financial services firm had tens of thousands employees that's Nick could never work in a big company says that he was I was almost allergic to working there. Once you've worked for a feisty company it's quite difficult to go work for something that's big dull and boring so he quits and then gets a job at the place that's actually one of being the last job will ever have. And in 1995 he goes and work starts working at marathon asset management he's going to wind up staying there for more than a decade and then wind up spinning out Nomad investment partnership from marathon asset management. This is the way he described the company's working for it was happy it was a scrappy high flying investment firm in London that was trying to outbox the big guys. Next mentor there was one of marathons co-founders can you Jeremy Hosking and this is how Nick describes him he's naturally iconoclastic his bias is to buy about the most despised thing you can find he likes the controversy he likes the difficulty. So the reason I was thinking about reading this now is because I just spent two weeks studying Lee Lou and there's a lot of similarities in the way they think in fact. The collection of Nomad investment partnership letters it starts with a letter from Nick sleep to Warren Buffett and then the response by Buffett and just like last week we saw the huge influence that buffett among her hat on Lee Lou it's the exact same thing for Nick and Zach. And one of the things that jumped out to me is Lee Lou talked about you know he started his fun right when the Asian financial crisis was happening. In ninety seven and we see that exact same event is what brings Nick Nick and Zach together so Nick is describing his mentor and one of the co-founders of. Marathon asset management you know he's like hey this guy's iconoclastic he likes controversy he likes difficulty I just sell me everything that other people won't buy. And so says the Asian financial crisis struck in nineteen ninety seven and so Nick and his mentor go scavenging for cheap stocks in the smoldering markets of Southeast Asia. Everybody else at the time is running for cover and they're like running in and it is through this process that they find this unlikely ally which is this Asian based broker who wasn't like everyone else that is Zach. And so Nick is at marathon asset management Zach is at Deutsche Bank they're talking regularly about all these crazy bargains that they're unearthing in places like Singapore Hong Kong the Philippines. And so Jeremy Hosking tells Zach hey when you can't sell a stock to anyone else call us and so this is what Nick means about Jeremy Hosking being naturally iconoclastic. In less than a year marathon invested about five hundred million dollars in Southeast Asia and made a killing as the region rebounded. So pre Asian financial crisis stocks are trading at like three times a replacement cost of their assets during the crisis they were buying those exact same stocks for one quarter of the replacement cost of their assets. And so it's after this when they recruit Zach to marathon so he moves from Hong Kong to London in two thousand and it says Zach escaped from Deutsche Bank to work with Nick as an analyst at marathons office in London. Together they traveled to Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting it was wonderful Zach said Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger spoke about companies they expected to own for decades. Oh my God thought Zach this is nothing to do with a casino this is about real businesses. Nick kept nagging his bosses to let him launch a concentrated fund within marathon with Buffett serving as his model. Buffett struck him as the embodiment of quality and so all throughout the margins all through these notes I'm constantly writing there when they mentioned things like this I just keep writing Lilo this is just like Lilo. In the interviews that you and I talked about last week you know Lilo is like hey I learned I stumbled into this did this random talk at Columbia from this Buffett guy turns out I went up learning from the very best I don't need anything else besides that. And so when you have somebody like Nick that was fundamentally changed by this book that says hey dedicate your life to the quality the quality of your craft. And then he goes to Omaha and he listens to the philosophy and the perspective of Buffett and realizes oh this is the above Buffett in my business Buffett is the embodiment of quality. So in 2001 Nick's bosses give him the green light to start Nomad Investment Partnership and then he asked Zach to join him as a co manager of the fund. And then go back to what Nick said about hey I was real comfortable I like being an outsider from a very young age and so he says it was obvious that we were always going to do something a little bit odd. From the start they regarded Nomad as an act of rebellion. And then this part just sings to my soul because they decide to concentrate on what to ignore this section is called never mind the bollocks I need to translate that to American for you never mind the bullshit is the way I would put it. And so they start out with a very simple ambition their target is a tenfold increase in Nomad's net asset value. And this is the part which I absolutely love there's a great line are great maxim from the history of entrepreneurship that comes up over there again this is genius has the fewest moving parts. I think about that often as a reminder myself to keep things simple so what do they do they have a one line description of actually what they want to do they want to 10x their their assets and to do so they work backwards from figuring out what to ignore. So Nick is going to quote the philosopher William James about their thinking it's gonna sound a lot like Buffett among her to Nick sites a line from the philosopher William James the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. We just got rid of all the things we didn't like they disregarded this is one of my favorite parts and this is why I say that this part sings to my soul they disregarded all ephemeral information. If federal information distracts investors or entrepreneurs are really anybody from what matters Nick notes that information like food has a sell by date. Some information is especially perishable while some information has a long shelf life this concept of shelf life became a valuable filter. And they're talking about the trap that most investors and I would say now most people everybody's second second the never ending now has my friend David calls it but specifically Nick and Zach are calling out what other most other investors do. They pay attention to fleeting news coverage and the daily soap opera that's what they call it Nick dismissively refers to these people as junkies who crave information which will be worthless in 12 weeks. As he sees it this short term crowd response constantly to fake stimuli and this is what he says about this you need to be wired not to believe the bullshit to not be listening. We became very happy not hearing it Nick and Zach told stockbrokers that it was pointless calling them with sales pitches since they relied on their own research to reach independent conclusions my favorite story of this and an inspiration for me I just finished reading. For the second time another biography and Sam Walton this is episode three fifty four the book is called Sam Walton the inside story of America's richest man. It was actually published before Sam wrote his own autobiography and there's a line in this I love where it says that on that day the market dropped and knocked a billion dollars off the value of Sam Walton stock holdings in Walmart. When reporters asked his reaction to the disaster on wall street he hadn't heard about it absolutely love that. When I went to dinner Charlie mongers house I asked him because I was obsessed with Costco and Jim synagogue one of my favorite forwards of any spoke of ever read is the fact that Jim synagogue wrote the forward for soul prices his hero and mentors biography. And I knew Charlie new gym and I was dying to find a book or some way to do an episode on Jim synagogue and I was like why isn't there information like why is it so low key and Charlie in his wisdom summarize that perfectly he's like that's cuz he was busy working. And so this idea of just I have to go back to this cuz this is I spend my time in a very similar way because I've never called it a femur ephemeral information like they did but I think that's a great line they disregard all ephemeral information if you look at how I spend my time in the mornings I read books usually old books about entrepreneurs in the afternoons I reread highlights from these old books about entrepreneurs and then I talked to founders and other smart people I spend time with my family I take care of my health and that's it. Nick and Zach call this practice a practice of intentional disconnection this is the important part because they knew they discovered that if they do deep research and find great businesses at fair prices and they keep them for a long period of time they don't have to do anything else. And so let's go to this description of this practice of intentional disconnection they wanted to think in peace undisturbed by popular obsession this requires uncommon conviction to disregard what most of your peers consider significant. So how do they spend their time we just read annual reports until we're blue in the face and visited every company we possibly could until we were sick of it when they analyze companies and interview CEOs Nick and Zach probe for insights with a long shelf life. Let's go back to that idea this concept of shelf life became a valuable filter they sought to answer such questions and here's some questions they would ask number one what is the intended destination for this business in 10 or 20 years number two. What must management be doing today to raise the probability of arriving at that destination number three and what could prevent this company from reaching such a favorable destination they refer to this way of thinking as destination analysis. Nick and Zach focused instead on the inputs required for a business to fulfill its potential such he works for people to it's worth noting that destination analysis is an equally handy tool and other areas of life so for example if your goal is to be healthy. You analyze the actions that you need to take now which will increase the odds of reaching that destination or if you want to be remembered lovingly by friends and families what are they at what are the actions take now to make sure that happens and they talk about you know when you look back very much like a Jeff Bezos mind frame. Nick says a few times like when you look back at your life like when you're 80 years old you're looking back at your life what do you want the life of that 80 year old to be. And so that is your destination and you analyze backwards working from that part work backwards from that destination back to the way they built and structured their firm as perennial outsiders they questioned everything and their organizing principle was this just very sophisticated simplicity. This attitude was influenced by that by the books and in the art of motorcycle maintenance the book reinforce their determination to resist any low quality behavior that they deemed self serving or deceitful this complete dedication to quality made life very straightforward it was all about quality. Money was secondary remember a few pages ago they talked about the founding of their firm as an act of rebellion this is this or this reminded me this paragraph reminded me of that there was something provocative about the whole thing. Zach said could you set up an investment firm which is not about the money it's about doing everything right and so they deliberately eliminate everything and they ignore everything outside of their insane focus which is this is what they were insanely focused on. We just concentrated on picking good stocks and thought everything else was peripheral. They also do something that's smart that reminded me of David Olgavee they have a no asshole rule rule they don't call it this but it says they took delight in turning away investors who seemed irritating regardless of how rich they were so there's a great line in one of Ogbe's books. Where you know he's has advertising clients he's running he's building this you know massively successful advertising agency and Ogbe says personal dislike made me resign many accounts if I don't like having to deal with the son of a bitch why should I. We and then his summary of this is fantastic if I don't like having to deal with the son of a bitch why should I we pass this way only once. We pass this way only once I think what David Ogbe has in common with Nick and Zach have in common and will you have in common is this desire to live an authentic life. If you listen to last week's episode where the very end Lee Lou writes this reflection of turning 50 and he says something that I think speaks to the main motivator a lot of people think in my opinion a lot of people that are not entrepreneurs think the main motivator for entrepreneurs is money and I would argue it's control. It's control of what you work on how you spend your time who's around you and it is the belief of the entrepreneur that if they have the control the money will come with that anyways but Lee Lou said something that was fascinating he says I kept going through life he's talking about. While all the time insisting on sitting in the driver's seat it is my life and my journey after all that is the exact same mindset that Nick and Zach had and you could see it in their actions I'm in the driver's seat I'm going to set up my company the way I see fit not the way I see fit. Not the way other people my industry think I should it's the exact same mindset that Ogilvy is expressing and saying hey you know if I don't like having to deal with this guy I'm going to fire the client I only live once I'm going to stay in the driver's seat in fact there's a hilarious story in one of Ogilvy's biographies you know I've read I don't know four or five books on them and they were talking about the fact that there was this association like a manufacturers association and they wanted to hire a new ad agency and they told all the people like okay well you know you have to come in and you pitch us and you're going to be one of maybe like ten different firms and you have fifteen minutes to make your pitch and as soon as the fifteen minutes is up we're going to ring this bell they had this giant like conference room you're going to ring the bell and no matter where you are it's over and so they lay out the ground rules at the very beginning of the pitch. It's Ogilvy sitting across from like twelve people and so they're telling them this you know you're one of many people pitching us and then you have fifteen minutes we're going to ring the bell and Ogilvy just asked was like well out of you twelve people who's going to be involved in making the decision. Which agency you picked and they go well all of us of course remember Ogilvy hated committees he famously said search all your parks search a park in every single city and you'll never find a statue dedicated to committees okay. So you hated committees and sitting in front of a committee like okay well twelve of us are going to pick the agency like who gets this account and then he asked him okay well how many of you are going to approve like be involved in actually approving the advertising that the agency creates. And they go all twelve of us of course and so Ogilvy goes okay ring the bell stands up and lease that is living life on your terms that is staying in the driver's seat. And so let's go back to more unique ways and how they built their investment partnership nomad never use leverage never shorted a stock never speculated with options or futures never made a macroeconomic bet never traded hyperactively in response to latest news never dabbled in exotic financial instruments instead Nick and Zach played what they viewed as a long. Simple game which involved buying a few intensely research stocks and holding them for years and Nick has two great lines on this I think are related he says you want to build something that has permanence and then this is one of my favorite sentences the entire section. I believe that good things grow and so if you are like Nick sleep and you believe that good things grow then of course you would focus on quality. The choosing of the investment partnerships name was intentional they named the fund nomad because they were willing to roam anywhere in search of value. They were gunning for outstanding absolute returns unconstrained by reference to what anyone else was doing and the fun begins to trade on September 10th 2001 one day before the attacks on the twin towers they start out buying cigar butts. Their story is going to reflect just like buff it and just like Lulu eventually all three of them are all four of them are going to come around to Charlie mongers point of view on this but at the very beginning they start to find things that are they can buy one quarter the replacement cost of the assets. They're buying assets in Thailand and United States and Zimbabwe these are not great businesses they're just fantastically cheap. And then within a few years of doing this they realize oh this is the strategy doesn't scale exactly among her figure out the strategy had a big drawback when stocks like these rebounded and we're no longer cheap you had to sell them and then hunt for new bargains. And so they come around to Charlie monger the architects point of view member buffett called monger the architect of Berkshire an obvious solution to this was to buy and hold higher quality businesses that were most likely to continue compounding for many years. This grew out of a costly mistake so in 2002 they find this business that they're going to invest in called stagecoach the stock had crashed from $2.84 down to 14 cents. But Nick and Zack figured that it was easily worth 60 cents so stage croaks is going to a turnaround led by the founders of the founder was a former bus conductor I gotta see if this guy's biography sounds fascinating. He's a former bus conductor who'd run the firm so well in the past that he become one of Britain's richest people. He comes out of retirement to try to fix this bus operation this United United Kingdom bus operation and his strategy worked. Now here's the problem Nick and Zack buy at 14 cents they cash out when when the stock rebounds to 90 cents and they're like wow we got a 6x return. But stagecoach winds up being a way better business than they realized and the stock shoots up to almost 4 bucks and Nick says that this made him and Zack feel like horses asses. And so their realization is hey we need to forget this cigar but business we need to find wonderful businesses and hold those businesses for the long term and the way they describe this is very fascinating and so Nick says. If you're thinking rationally and thinking about the long term you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them meaning these one of these people these phenomenal managers many cases founders larger larger shareholders of the businesses. The ones that are actually running and care deeply about these these wonderful businesses that they're building so he says you're thinking rationally and thinking about the long term you can subcontract the capital allocation decisions to them. You don't have to be buying and selling shares so once they realize okay we want to buy wonderful businesses then they have to first the first step is they have to begin thinking about. What are the characteristics that account for the success of companies that have unusually long shelf lives and is through this research and study that they wind up. Coming to the conclusion that there's one business model that is more powerful than all the rest and their term for this is scale economies shared. This business model is well known now I think at the time they were the first ones to actually coin that and the first company to introduce them to this model was Costco they first invest in Costco in 2002. At the time the stock the Costco stock had gone from $55 all the way down to 30 so they start buying at 30 it had tumbled because people Wall Street did not like the company's low profit margins. So that was the surface level understanding or misunderstanding of Costco okay but Nick and Zach saw underappreciated strength in Costco's fanatical focus on delivering value to shoppers. One of the things that Nick and Zach realizes the low profit margins is actually an asset not a liability Costco marked up as goods by no more than 15% above cost while typical supermarket might markup prices up to 30%. To the skeptics on Wall Street this generosity seems soft and uncompetitive the corporate equivalent of collectivism that's hilarious. But Nick and Zach saw the long term logic of Costco's strategy. Satisfied customers and this is the flywheel that they describe satisfied customers kept returning and spending more money in its stores thereby generating enormous revenues. As the company grew in negotiated better deals with suppliers and then kept driving down its famously low costs. Costco then shared these economies of scale with consumers by lowering its prices even further Nick and Zach estimated that the Costco members saved $5 for every dollar that Costco kept for itself. This policy of self restraint was a virtuous cycle that Nick sums up like this increased revenues begets scale savings begets lower costs begets lower prices begets increased revenues. And this is another great thought right here most big successful corporations eventually lapse in a mediocrity. But Costco's readiness to share the benefits of its scale with customers meant that size became an advantage not a burden. Costco kept growing by giving back instead of grabbing all the spoils for itself its low margins reflected patience not weakness in the in the view of Nick and Zach. Nick explained the firm is deferring profits today in order to extend the life of the franchise. This giving back makes Costco's customers unbelievably loyal I said this before I didn't even know what Costco was until it was introduced to it by my wife's family my wife's family have been members at Costco for over 25 years it's probably close I think it's closer to 30 years by now. And they're still shopping there all the time almost 30 years of loyalty to Costco so Nick and Zach kept adding to their investment as their reference for Costco grew at the time they're telling the story they owned Costco for 18 years. And over that time period rose from $30 a share to $380 a share all while also paying rich dividends and so this new strategy is also in line with how Nick and Zach want to spend their time. They don't want to be trading all the time they want to be reading the news they want to be sitting reading thinking and talking to each other. It says one of the benefit of this inactivity the fact that they're just going to hold this forever and they're not going to trade all the time. Is that Nick and Zach had time to rethink and talk at length about what they were learning and this is a fascinating part because this talks about what emerged from the discussions they're having is that hey scale economy shared model is actually the greatest business model because it fosters corporate longevity. This is going to be Nick and Zach's earned secret one of my favorite tweets of all time comes from this guy named Cedric chin and he said I'm starting to think that one type of remarkable career and certainly the most interesting type. Comes from finding an earned secret and then exploiting the hell out of it for a good part of two to three decades so he was describing Mark Leonard of constellation realizing that hey. Vertical market software companies are kind of terrible for venture the business he used to be in but they're great to own long term so this idea. That a one type of remarkable career comes from finding an earned secret and then exploiting the hell out of it for a good part of two to three decades. That is what is occurring where we are in this story because Nick and Zach start asking themselves again they go hey what characteristics account for the success of companies that have these unusually long shelf lives and how can we find this out well turns out history has answers. And so they go back and they're studying all these businesses in history and so says they studied walmart's annual reports from the 1970s they realized it had much in common with Costco. Likewise durable winners such as Dell computer Southwest Airlines Tesco all followed a similar path these formidably efficient firms kept costs low. And pass most of their savings back to consumers who reciprocated by doing more business with them my wife's family has been reciprocating for almost 30 years. What is the value of that single customer and how many people have they recruited to the cult of Costco in three decades. More examples from history this time there's like hey let's take a look at what buffets investing in in the same vein Geico and Nebraska furniture mark. Two of buffets favorite businesses continue to drive down costs as they grew enabling him to save their customers so much money that it became increasingly difficult for rivals to compete let's go even further back in history Henry Ford. He harnessed the benefits of the assembly line production to drop the price of the model T I've done like what six podcasts on Henry Ford I'll probably do one every you know two years going forward. But he used this increased benefits tech and technology and efficiency to drive down the price from model T from $850 to less than $300. And so Nick says this is not a new business model but it does need to be pursued with a van evangelical zeal that is great line it does need to be pursued with evangelical zeal. This culture of such companies is typically molded by visionary founders they tend to be there so they're talking about the characteristics of great businesses characteristics of great business models now they've moved into the kind of people that can actually do this for decades. The characteristic of the founder or the leader in this case they tend to be passionate about the smallest details. They tend to be passionate about proving the customer experience cutting costs even in good times and investing for the distant future despite external pressures to report strong numbers now. They have to be almost high on being iconoclastic Nick said so he's talking about Sam Walton he mentions all these people in the book Sam Walton Jim cynical Herb Keller Rose Blumkin. Done podcast multiple I guess on all of them and it's so it's to all this research to all this learning to all the studying for us thinking that they discover the Nick and Zach discover their own secret. Once Nick and Zach understood the magic of this one business model they made it the focus of their fund. They knew they had uncovered a deep truth and this is what they said this is Nick talking that is the single best thought you may have have ever had in your life it needs to dominate everything. Because you're not going to get many insights like that. And so now that they have the focus of their fund we're going to focus on businesses that are using scale economy shared you can go out look for more and this is when they discover Amazon Amazon gets it I think at one point. What is it like 70% of their net worth so says when Nick first encountered Amazon in 1997 it was an upstart bookseller trying to go public. Jeff Bezos gave a presentation in London explaining how he would offer an almost infinite selection of books how it gain a cost advantage by avoiding the expensive physical stores and how it reinvest in cash flow the cash flow makes in other businesses. Nick race back to his office at marathon and told his boss this is absolutely fantastic it could be huge but his boss said yeah but OK but what are they doing that no one else can do it took years. For Nick and Zach to grasp the nature of Amazon's competitive advantage. Jeff Bezos was following in the hallowed footsteps of Henry Ford Sam Walton Jim cynical and the Internet would enable him to turbo charge their classic strategy like them. Bezos was ruthlessly efficient about controlling costs this is a new story for me I don't remember reading and I've read you know everything you can find on Jeff and Amazon. Amazon went so far as to save $20,000 a year by removing the light bulbs from the vending machines in its offices Bezos was obsessed. With saving money and time for his customers and he invested patiently for the future seeding new business initiatives that he didn't expect to bear fruit for years each year he invested hundreds of millions. In the form of discounted prices and shipping subsidies Wall Street grumbled about Amazon's lack of recorded reported profits a lot of people forget that. Amazon at one time the stock price I think went fell from $181 all the way down to six if I'm not mistaken. So says Wall Street failed to appreciate that Bezos was patiently laying the groundwork for mind blowing growth. This is what Bezos wrote to Amazon shareholders in 2005 he says relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers. In the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to much larger dollar amount of free cash flow and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon Nick and Zach had found their corporate soulmate. When Bezos unveiled Amazon Prime Nick and Zach recognized instantly that this was the Amazonian equivalent of Costco's annual membership feed oh my God I know exactly what game they're playing Nick thought. And so they start buying Amazon aggressively in 2005 around $30 per share okay so. I think this is really important there's a bunch of notes I left to myself there's this idea of slow than fast. And it has to do with the importance of building this like encyclopedic base of knowledge let me give you a story from founder first and I think Warren Buffett an example of this and Lelouch is as well this is why it's top of mind given what I've been reading the past few weeks but. Sam Walton most remarkable things you know he's the greatest retailer to ever live. He had one store for the first five years of his career he focused on one store and so over the decades he winds up building up this encyclopedic base of knowledge of retailing and so when he sees another opportunity. In a sense when he sees the Costco opportunity the Sam's Club opportunity. It's an opportunity preparing his whole life for and because he has this encyclopedic base of knowledge that has compounded over the years he able to move he goes from moving very slow to very fast one store in five years is very slow. Decades into his career he opens up I can remember the number I think it was from zero Sam's Club so let's say 100 Sam's Clubs from zero revenue to like five billion a year I think in five to seven years. Lelouch talked about this when he was chastising the Columbia MBA students because he's like listen when I was your age when I was in this class I got this giant book this value line book you know that you can see in the video looks like you could work out with it's right you know I don't know 800 pages something like that he goes I read it cover to cover multiple times. And that's the way to do it because you build up this encyclopedic base of knowledge and then after you do that he says you can look at a page and value line and in seconds you can see if there's something more you need to look into. That is example going slow so you can go faster later on there is this AMA this ask me anything that that Alice Schroeder did on red Alice Schroeder is the woman that wrote the author that wrote the snowball like 20 something years ago. And she talks about observing Warren Buffett's reading process now you know at that point he was what let's call 40 years into his career 50 years something like that. And so because he's been reading annual reports for 50 years or longer and that knowledge is compounded he can actually read an annual report faster that compounding base of knowledge acts like a filter to separate the important from the unimportant. And so think about how this relates to what Nick and Zach are experiencing their four years into their fun but they're you know 15 years into their career they know what they like what they don't like they've done intense amounts of reading studying talking to each other about what they learned. Identifying the earned secret all that years and years of work now allows them to go fast where they're like wait a minute this exactly Lee Lou said because he was like he talks about some things you're not going to learn in your career you're going to learn today that you won't use for 15 years he's like I was studying an American company 15 years ago. It took me 15 years to find its Asian counterpart but then I as soon as I saw it I knew it. It's exactly what's taking place they did all this work to get this earned secret to understand the importance and the power of this business model of the other businesses that use the business model scale economy shared that when they see. What Bezos is doing Amazon prime like oh my God this is Costco but on the Internet. The encyclopedic base of knowledge you cannot shortcut because the encyclopedic base of knowledge is what helps you move quicker in the future slow and then fast. In 2006 Nick and Zach resigned from marathon and made Nomad a fully independent fund giving themselves even more latitude to follow their idiosyncratic convictions. A quarter of their clients yank their money from Nomad fearful of its over exposure to one stock. A year or two later Amazon lost half of its market value in 2008 and Nomad fell 45.3% in the margin I wrote Lee Lou happens to everyone what am I referencing last week Lee Lou said Berkshire listen this. Amazon loses half of its market value in 2008 Nomad goes falls down by 45.3% Lee Lou said last week or on last week's episode Berkshire had at least three times when the stock went down 50% it happened to Carnegie to it happened to Rockefeller this happens to even mighty companies. He was talking about the importance of temperament because when this happens people start freaking out they panic. Nick and Zach did not they did not crack why others panic they exploited the market mayhem to upgrade this and this is. This blew my mind everyone else is panicking they're like okay cool opportunity here we're going to upgrade our portfolio concentrating even more heavily on its highest quality companies, including Amazon Costco and Berkshire. When the rebound came the rewards were breathtaking over the next four years Nomad returned 404%. In early 2014 Nick and Zach dissolved the Nomad investment partnership by then it had grown to about $3 billion in assets, I think it made $2 billion for its investors. This is what Nick said about this many funds start with lots of cake as their goal lots of money Nick wrote. It's not the cake that gratifies us what we found gratifying was the process of solving the investment problem learning along the way and doing as good a job as we knew how. Those were all internal personal goals the cake was then a happy byproduct. After they closed the partnership Nick wrote a letter to Buffett thanking him for his role and Nomad success Buffett replied you and Zach have made the right choice I predict you will find life is just beginning. In retirement Zach kept half a dozen or so of his favorite stocks from Nomad's portfolio Zach who had never sold a share of Amazon in his personal portfolio has about 70% of his money riding on that one stock. Nick invested almost all of his money in just three stocks Amazon Costco and Berkshire. And this is what he said about that there are very few businesses that are investing in the future the way they are they don't care about Wall Street they don't care about trends they don't care about fads they're just doing the right thing long term. So they close the partnership in 2014 by 2018 Amazon had risen so much that accounted for more than 70% of Nick's net worth Nick began to worry could Amazon's market value grow to three or $4 trillion or were there limits even to Amazon's greatness he wasn't sure. So after 13 years he sold half of his stake in a single day for $1500 a share how did it feel I hated it he says I felt horribly conflicted and i'm not sure it was a good decision. And that is where I leave it for the full story highly recommend buying the book this is a no brainer I mean Nick sleeps telling you hey you should read William Green's book it's excellent we're sure you're going to enjoy it I definitely agree with Nick there's wonderful profiles on other investors in the book other traits that other investors have it's just wonderfully written. So for the full story if you want to buy the book using the link that's in the show notes in your podcast player are available founders podcast.com you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time I printed out all of Nick sleeps partnership letters. And so that is what I'm reading this week that'll be the next episode but for now that is 364 books down 1000 ago and I talked again soon.
