--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the story of a marvelous financial calamity. Not so wonderful if you happen to be a creditor, of which there are 50,000 at current count, but marvelous in the way that it happened. A stranger comes to Wall Street, borrows nearly $4 billion to acquire a company that six months earlier he had never even heard of. This transaction is scarcely settled before he's allowed to borrow $7 billion more to acquire a bigger company, making him a major force in retailing, an industry he knows nothing about. The companies he acquired were successful retail enterprises which before Bob accidentally having taken an interest in them had a 50-year unbroken record of paying their bills. They were also old-fashioned, that is to say, relatively free of debt. Acquired is really too bland a word to describe the involuntary surrender to the new-fangled corporate coup known as the Leveraged Buyout. In theory, the LBO was supposed to boost productivity and increase profits once the new owner had supplanted the complacent, unimaginative, and overpaid former management. In practice, the LBOs landed both companies in Chapter 11. Among other notable side effects from Bob's joint ventures, abetted by the best and brightest bankers and buyout specialists on Wall Street, are the following. 8,000 workers laid off. First, Boston, the once mighty investment firm having to be bailed out after several of its bridge loans went kapui. The collapse of the junk bond market. A slump in profits for department stores nationwide. The dumping of merchandise on discount stores by manufacturers with no place to sell their goods. The cutback in department store advertising which spread the misery into the newspaper and magazine businesses. The recession on Wall Street. This was an era of debtor barons when billions went out to all sorts of imaginative speculations. Bob arrived at the perfect moment in the final stage of the buyout frenzy when playing it safe counted for nothing. The bankruptcy courts are now clogged with the results of these full hearty endeavors. That is an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today which is Going for Broke. How Robert Campu bankrupted the retail industry, jolted the junk bond market, and brought the booming 80s to a crashing halt and was written by John Rothschild. Okay, so I had never heard of this book before. I actually got a message from a misfit named Chris and I want to read part of the message he sent to me because he's talking about why he recommends this book and it's a great description of what we're going to learn today. He says, it is a how not to run a business and the perils of overconfidence with debt. This underrated book provides a glimpse into what happens when dreams become delusions. And that's a great way to think about what we're going to learn today. We're going to build an anti-model. So we're going to get the essence of who Bob was, how he made decisions, and we're going to be able to in the future when you think of a decision you have to make you just think, what would Bob do and do the opposite because this guy is a clown. So I'm going to jump right into the book. The intro I just read to you said right up front the author tells us how it ends. So now we know he winds up in bankruptcy. We know that the supposed quote unquote best and brightest minds lent this guy $11 billion with almost no money down. Within a few short years, he's in bankruptcy. He's harmed tons of people because of his irresponsible actions. So now the entire book is about how did this happen? And I'm going to give you a little bit about his personality and you'll see the author is kind of ruthless in how he describes this guy. I'm going to call him Bob. Everybody calls him Bob. So I'm just going to refer to him as Bob the whole time throughout the book because I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name. Bob subjected himself to a barrage of improvements. First a toupee, then hair transplants, facelifts, sheep brain injections for longevity, which he flew to Europe to receive, roughing rituals, health food diets, and a daily swim in a specially purified pool. The urge to supersede, to win, to maximize his every opportunity was a constant theme in his personal history. And so now there's going to be a brief description of his early life and his career before he gets to Wall Street. So he says he entered the world in 1923 as the son of a blacksmith. He was raised with seven siblings. Seven other siblings died. His earliest known entrepreneurial venture was peddling newspapers on the street corner. In eighth grade, he quit school to take a job sweeping floors for 50 cents an hour. Bob's career in real estate, so before he was a rather successful real estate developer, before he had this idea he wanted to be, he wanted to play on Wall Street. He wanted to go to the United States, which makes this story even more tragic because he could have just stopped there, stayed within his circle of competence, and he would have had a lot better life. He winds up losing everything, a multi-hundred million dollar fortune that he bets on just a really silly idea of being the world's largest retailer, even though he wasn't particularly interested in retailing. So it says Bob's career in real estate was launched somewhat accidentally in 1949 after he had tried a variety of jobs. So he had worked as a mill writer, he hauled logs, he ran a small grocery store. His cousin Tony had built a house in his spare time and then sold it and doubled his money in a few months. Impressed with these results, Bob suggested a partnership. Bob and Tony invested $5,000 on the house, doing most of the carpentry themselves, and then sold it for $7,500. This soon led to the buying and selling of more houses, which led to subdivisions and then it just continues on and on. Bob foresaw the great post-war migration to the suburbs and built himself and put himself in the middle of it. He advanced from home building to subdividing, from subdividing to building apartments, from building apartments to putting up office towers. By the 1950s, Bob had become a comfortably wealthy man. In the 1960s, he became even wealthier. Largely thanks to the half a million square feet of office space that he constructed in Ottawa, most of it rented to the Canadian government. In the condo boom of the 1970s, he expanded his operation in the United States and building condos and office towers in California, Florida, and Texas. All right, so let's go back to that thought for just a second that he would have been better off if he would have stayed within his circle of competence and never got involved in Wall Street. He might have still failed and went bankrupt anyways because he loved being over leveraged. There's several other Canadian real estate developers that he gets involved with in the book and they're talked about in the book about being much smarter and more wealthy than him. When this book ends, they're not bankrupt. I went and looked up and see if I could find books on these guys. Turns out they all go bankrupt too. But the reason I wanted to circle back around to that thought is because really it's a fantasy because this guy was easily distracted. This next section I'm going to read to you, we're going to see a bunch of these anti-patterns these traits that he had that we just want to do the opposite of. It says, I'm going to skip over the person's names because it's not important, but he was also aware of Bob's wild card reputation, his quick temper, his absurd grandiosity, his tendency to veer off on exotic tangents outside of real estate, many of which were pursued wholeheartedly and then dropped. So he jumps around a lot. He's not thorough. There's a difference between like we talk about Steve Jobs reality distortion field and the idea that Marc Andreessen has that the world is a lot more malleable than you think. And if you focus all your efforts that you can change the world around you. That's not Bob's version of grandiosity. This guy lives in a fantasy land that has no attachment to any form of reality by any means. But just his absurd grandiosity. So you've got a quick temper. He yells at people way too. I'm going to read some ridiculous way he treats his employees. And then this idea of, you know, he jumps from one thing to one. He just quits at everything. He gets excited. If you can have, there's a lot of people in the book that have influence over him because he'll listen to basically the last idea. So the last idea he heard is the best idea until he hears another idea. And then that idea is just better. And so he just gives up and he never allows things to compound. And so here's an example of these things that he got excited about and then he, there was a water powered dishwasher that he wanted to make cardboard box houses for the third world. The investments in technology companies that were announced with great fanfare because he started a tech investing firm in 1981 and then abandoned it in 1982. And then his sudden urge to own a TV station. And so we're going to see this jumping around is how he got the idea to get involved. He doesn't know what an LBL is yet, but he will. And so he said, Hey, I want to, I want to acquire something, look for an acquisition for me. So he hires people to go out and look for things that he could buy. And this guy, Randall is one of the first ones. He says, at this point in our story, this is January, 1986, Randall wasn't even dreaming of putting allied stores. So this is going to be the first conglomerate retail conglomerate that he's going to buy. And it starts out by just saying, Hey, maybe you want to buy some of their shopping centers since you're a real estate developer. Right? So it says Randall wasn't even dreaming of putting allied stores on Bob's potential acquisition list. A sensible man, Randall knew that allied stores was a department and specialty store conglomerate with a market value of $2 billion and 70,000 employees. He also knew that Bob's corporation had a market value of 200 million and was a real estate enterprise with fewer than 1000 employees. What blows your mind is the financial machinations that happens in this book. They're extremely complicated. That allows a $200 million company to overtake a $2 billion company with nothing but debt. That the one could be overcome by the other was the farthest thing from his mind. Besides, Bob had never mentioned retailing as one of his interests. He had never even stepped foot in an allied store before. No, Randall's hunch was that Bob, who owned shopping centers, might be interested in buying the five shopping centers owned by allied stores. In one of their phone conversations, Randall brought up allied stores for the first time. Bob had never heard of it. So Bob shoots him down at first because he's like, No, I've been reading a newspaper and I've read that Macy's is about to be taken private. Get me a meeting with the Macy's CEO. And they try to get a meeting with the CEO. And he's like, who is it? Like, no, I'm not going to meet with this guy. What the hell is going on? So he says he was thinking about the Macy's leveraged buyout, which he'd been following in the newspapers. Finding an acquisition was no longer his priority. Now he wanted to participate in the Macy's LBL. So you'll see, it's very interesting how this idea constantly morphs. So at first it's like, I'm not going to do an LBL myself. I'm going to, instead of doing an acquisition, I'll just invest in this LBL of Macy's. So get Finkelstein, I think is the guy's at the time, the CEO of Macy's. And Finkelstein's like, no, I'm not meeting with this guy. So this continues to develop. I'm skipping along. He says, spurned by Macy's, Bob called yet another strategy session. Let's delve into allied a little bit more, he told Randall. So it talks about Randall's assumption. Okay, we're going to go back to the shopping centers. That's easy. He says Randall's assumed at first, at first that delving into further into allied meant that five shopping centers, but it didn't. It meant that Bob was thinking about taking over the whole company. So he says, having learned to expect the unexpected from this unusual client and unusual is like the most tepid way you could put that. Just a few weeks back, Randall figured that Bob might be interested in attracting a single Brooks Brothers store into one of his malls. Now in a great imaginary leap. Again, that's a very different from a reality distortion field, or thinking that the world is malleable. He just completely makes up these scenarios in his mind. It's almost like he's suffering from mental illness. Bob had vaulted himself into the ownership of all 45 Brooks Brothers stores. Again, this is in his mind. Plus, and it's going to name all these other Ann Taylor, Jordan Marshall, all the other, there's 24 divisions of allied at this point. Okay. It was clear what had happened. This is why I'm telling you this. Having been rejected by Macy's in its LBO, Bob had decided to do a Macy's style LBO on allied, putting himself in the role of Finkelstein. So now we go into his plan. And even though I knew how the book ended, you're going to, well, the most common word I have for the notes I left myself is unbelievable because it's just, there's just mind blowing things that happen in this book. But the note I left myself is here is of course the banks aren't going to lend Bob the money to buy allied, but I already knew they would. It's just, you read about this guy and just like, how did this happen? Just as Bob's brain trust was engaged in a continuous behind the scene struggle to keep the bosses in petuacies. I'm not pronouncing that word correct in check. The man had some great ideas, but from the earliest days, advisor's had to try to subdue his wilder impulses. He has no self control, no discipline at all. As the operation got bigger, his impulses got wilder. In 1970, Bob seeded control in his own, this is more about his inability to focus and how he jumps around. Bob seeded control in his own company to a fellow Canadian entrepreneur in a complicated exchange of shares, a decision he soon regretted. Two years later, he was able to buy back his own shares back. So he's buying back his own company at a much higher price. Remember that because this guy gets taken advantage of over and over again. They just see a sucker and in some cases the banks will wind up being suckers right along with them, but he gets pumped for so much money and fees. It's going to blow your mind. So now he decides, okay, I'm going to exchange shares. Oh, I regret this. Let me buy back my own company at a much higher price two years later. Oh, okay. To buy back his own shares at a much higher price with the help from a loan of all places, the Vatican. This is also what I don't understand. The fact that this guy does have these wild imaginations, his wild fantasies in mind. He is very charismatic to some people and he's able to convince these people to lend him. I mean, there's so many, there's Japanese, Canadian, European, American banks and financial institutions, private entrepreneurs that loan this guy money. It's just amazing to me. Bob's fascination with the giant US retailer seemed to be so preposterous that they couldn't really believe that their boss was serious. The best course of action they decided, this is his brain trust, okay, was to relax. Let's play along and then hope that the allied infatuation would pass. Even if it didn't, the banks would surely put the kibosh on such a project by refusing to lend money to it. And the realities of the marketplace, as they called it, would send Bob a message. And here's what something that's going on is the fact that Bob's at the right, he's got in this this perverse way, he's at his timing is perfect because it says Bob's timing couldn't have been better. Buyouts and takeovers were now all the rage. Wall Street was uncovering one undervalued situation after another, but he's going to come in right before this bubble is going to burst. This is just crazy. Bob nor his advisors really knew one investment bank from another. You know how they decide to who to call? They pick up the yellow pages. It was basically a matter of looking up names in the yellow pages. So they they just go under investment banks, start calling them, wind up the first four, they're like, no, kick rocks guy. It was zero for four at this point. A result that knew the surprise nor dismayed Bob's two sidekicks who were somewhat relieved that the marketplace had given the right message. As a last resort, they made an appointment at Payne Weber. Unfortunately, Payne Weber entertains this idea. I know he's going to use them as long as they are like he finds utility out of them and then he's going to drop them for somebody else. But we're not there yet. Bob secretly began to buy. So this is the plan one, right? Because they don't there's just no way that they're going to lend him money right away. This is I guess let me back up. I need to explain the point more clearly. It's not like he jumps from no money down to $11 billion. He takes one step. Then once he gets further down the line, he it's actually there's some form of intelligence on how he approaches this, because he builds up like this this equity in this capital to other to the other people's reputation. So everybody says no, then he gets a a meeting at Payne Weber, they give him a tepid endorsement, right? Then he gets an attorney that's very famous for handling like M&A transactions on Wall Street. And then he uses the name Payne Weber and that attorney to open another door. And so all throughout this book, you're going to see people substituting instead of them thinking for themselves, they substitute their own thinking for the results of other people's thinking. And so that allows him to just keep getting to the next like further down the line. And then eventually goes so far down the line. And some of these banks have so much money at stake that they have no choice but to keep throwing good money after bad. But before we get there, let me go into like his more of just that he has this nervous breakdown. He's a big he's a bigamist. He's got two families. They say he's not a bigamist, but he was for a certain amount of time. Bob secretly began to buy shares and allied through a dummy corporation called Perez Capital. Ally didn't know this was the first way he did his first strategy. Okay. Bob didn't know that Payne Weber didn't really believe he had any chance to take over allied. And Payne Weber didn't know about Bob's nervous breakdowns, or about his two families with two wives and two sets of children, which he'd maintained for several years. He had had and they're talking about two times in his career. He had these nervous breakdowns where there was months where he was unable to get out of bed. This is more about his leading his double lives. And then eventually people finding out that he's two families and this is going to remind this part reminded me of when back on I think it's like founders somewhere in the early 100s. I read the biography of Frank Lloyd Wright. And I'll explain what I mean by that after I read the section. He says, For three years, Bob kept up this exhausting routine. So he's got the two wives, multiple families routine, while somehow finding the energy to do his real estate deals. At his headquarters in Ottawa, key employees aware of his situation had begun to gossip, which eventually caused Bob to summon them to a special meeting in which he admitted to his double life. At the same time, he made it clear that he'd never tolerate such behavior on the part of anyone else on the payroll, who'd be fired on the spot for pulling a stunt similar to his. Only an extraordinary person, he said, could stand up to the strain. This guy is bananas that he would say that. But we've seen this before. Frank Lloyd Wright winds up getting the time he's having an affair. I think in the state he's in, it's like illegal. Adultery was actually illegal. I think he gets arrested for if I remember correctly, then he holds a press conference on Christmas Day. And he actually says this, he says, Listen, rules are for normal people. I, Frank Lloyd Wright, am not normal. Essentially, Bob just did the same thing with his employees. Right. So let's go back to the very beginning of this first financial transaction. Payne Webber knows that he doesn't have the money to buy allies. So they're trying to get creative. Payne Webber's plan was for Bob to buy a sizable chunk of allied stock, then approached the CEO about cooperating in some sort of friendly deal. Further study of Bob's assets had reinforced the suspicion that a hostile takeover was out of the question, since Bob would have to borrow up to $2.5 billion to buy all of allied's 50 million shares. He didn't expect that Bob could borrow up to $2.5 billion with only 100 to 150 million for a down payment, which is what Bob had told Payne Webber that he could come up with. So he's not only dealing with Payne Webber, he's also going around having these healthy meetings and everyone thinks the same thing. They're amused at how absurd Bob's idea is that his tiny little company is going to take over allied. So this is Lehman Brothers was impressed by two things, the man's obvious, if naive enthusiasm and the absurdity of his proposition. Those who doubted that Bob could acquire allied had grown into a large crowd that include Bob's brain trust, his advisors back in Toronto, his Toronto bankers, his advisors from Payne Webber and now his lawyer. And so Bob is just keep marching on. He's like, I'm going to do this regardless. I don't even think he even understood people doubted him. I don't even think it penetrated his brain. So it says, but now here we get to the, the, how like the foundation for, or I guess a shaky foundation that this is all built on. It says the cash itself didn't have to be there. What was required was the promise of cash, which various reliable sources would provide for a fee and wait till you get, wait till I get to the fees. This is going to blow your mind. So what Bob had was Payne Webber's assurance that it could raise at a considerable chunk of the necessary amount by selling junk bonds. Remember this is the 80s, this is the end of the 80s. This is a junk bond era, right? So that's going to be one way. They're not going to finance the entire acquisition this way. It says junk bonds in themselves were not enough to launch a credible offer along with this, with this unsecured debt, which is why it's called junk. Bob would also need some secured debt money that a commercial bank would agree to loan against the assets of the would be target allied, which is crazy is how this loose definition of security that some of these financial institutions use. In one case, he's borrowing money against his own shares and they're using the shares as collateral. The shares go from like $50 a share down to, I think $4 a share. So it's not actually a secure debt. Then he gets in like this web of promises when you, once it winds up in bankruptcy court, he discovers that he had promised like there's multiple people that have collateral on the same asset. So that complicates things because he's essentially just going out there and giving promises, the same promises to multiple people, which obviously you can't do. So one institution that he goes to is CityCorp and they give him this great nickname of the mad bomber. This was CityCorp's first clue that they were dealing with a volatile character who soon acquired the in-house nickname mad bomber. Whether the bank should have anything to do with the mad bomber was hotly debated. The pro Bob faction won the debate with three persuasive arguments. Number one, if it all went well, Bob might use CityCorp as this banker in the future, in future real estate deals. Number two, a peek at allied's balance sheets showed that there was more than enough collateral to cover a CityCorp secured takeover loan. That here's the problem with this assumption. Number two, they thought he was going to have a professional manager. He eventually hires a professional CEO and says, no, I'm going to do this. And then goes around and just runs the company terribly. Because again, he's never even stepped foot in one of these stores. Number three, Bob said that he could put up to 300 million of his own money on the table's equity. That is also a lie. And part of a way to understand why these banks would kind of talk themselves into, they have weak arguments, they build one assumption on top of another, one weak assumption on top of another weak assumption is because at this time, they're just making so much money from M&A activity. And I'll get into the actual numbers and you just see, you're just blinded by it. And I think it's in human nature. It's not like they're necessarily, I mean, they definitely did dumb things. But I think a lot of people that were in their same shoes would be blinded by like, it's clearly in our nature to be to have the capacity to be blinded by greed. So I think that's the lesson. It's like, okay, you know, we're kind of poking fun at these guys. Look, look how stupid they are. I cannot believe they wind up, you know, betting in first Boston's case, they bet so much money on just one flaky dude, that they wind up having to build out themselves. But this has happened over and over again. So it's just like, we can't think it's like, like, it's not it's not unique to them. We have to be aware of our capacity in our own lives to make foolish decisions. And again, avoidance. I guess one of the main lessons from here from this book is I was thinking about what Charlie Munger says, says, he's got this great anecdote. He's like, tell me where where I'm going to die. So I'll never go there. And it's like you study the decisions they made. And so you can avoid putting yourself in situations that all the parties are in here, Bob, his staff, the people in the banking, the people running allied and federated, all these people, there's just a combination of one bad decision after another. This is a note of myself on this page, odd duck, this guy, look at what he does here. Bob, he's in the middle of a negotiation to purchase some some shopping centers, which just talks about the way he negotiates in general. Bob wasn't budging either. He hadn't gotten to where he was by budging. Once at a retirement party for a longtime employee, he tried to make a deal to buy back the man's stock at a favorable price. Once the sale of his house in Ottawa to his own daughter was stalled over his insistence that the washer dryer unit didn't come with the property and still belong to him. There's another example once the sale on the sale of a $600,000 apartment building in Ottawa was held up. Why Bob and the buyer argued over who got to keep the lawnmower, never underestimate humans capacity to focus on the unimportant. Okay, so I want to go back to this point I tried to make earlier. And this is the note I was referencing, he actually does something smart, just focus on getting the next step done. Future problems will have future solutions. And he was getting turned down by a bunch of people at the very beginning, the further along the process goes, the more they're just they wind up yielding to his wishes. So it says there was but one course of action left short of going home. Make a hostile bid to the shareholders and conquer allied against the management's will, which is exactly what Payne Weber and his attorney said they would not do at the very beginning. When neither Payne Weber nor Finkelson had thought Bob capable of doing, they were now helping him to do. Payne Weber had expressed distaste for hostile deals at the initial meeting with Bob in July, how quickly this resistance was overcome as soon as Bob decided to do one in September. Payne Weber, in fact, was delighted to continue to participate in the zany escalation of the allied Bob conflict. A remarkable pilgrimage was soon on its way to Bob's world world off Historia suite. So now once they realize this guy's going to do a hostile takeover, he's already with Payne Weber, he's with this other respected attorney, you see a series of more respected banks get involved. And he leverages their name to take for more institutions just kind of builds on all these reputations, right? So it says Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, First Boston, all they just the list goes on and on. And it talks about these people have done more than 200 billion in M&A transactions in 1985. I think we're still 1986. So they're fresh off. Okay, last year, we killed it. We made hundreds of billions of dollars doing this. Let's see if we can do more. How things have changed in six months. People that had previously wanted nothing further to do with Bob after the facelift incident. So he missed a meeting. No one could find him because he flew down to Brazil. This guy, he flew down to Brazil to get a facelift didn't tell anybody where he was just very strange. So now they're saying, okay, we don't want anything to do with this guy, you know, now six months later, it's like, okay, now all three were competing for his business. None of them had heard of Bob at all. What sent them scrambling to his suite was a tip from Finkelson, a guy from Canada wants to do a hostile. So again, that's his attorney that's respected by the bankers. He's saying, hey, this guy wants to do it. Okay, I'm going to run up and I'm going to compete for this business. Let's go more into like the historical to give you like historical context of what's happening at this time. And this guy right here, Wasserstein, what's his first name? Bruce Bruce Wasserstein. He's actually one of the smartest ones in all this. He's like credited with being the most prominent merger and acquisition, like person responsible for a lot of these. He did, he went to doing over a hundred thousand transactions for like 250 billion dollars. And the reason I say he's one of the smartest ones is I again, I don't really like what he was doing with these companies, but he doesn't, he's, he's not, he's smart enough not to put himself on personal liability. So a lot of the companies like first Boston is a company he works for. Eventually he feels he's underpaid because he's doing like 80 to 90% of their profits, which is bananas. So he winds up going on on his own, winds up surviving. He died about 10 or 15 years ago, something like that. And you know, he died with a net worth of a couple of billion dollars. He just, he, he, he didn't take the tail risks that other institutions did. I guess that's that's what I mean by he was smart. So it says, uh, Wasserstein's highly publicized success. So it talks about he took, he did Texaco's $10 billion acquisition of Getty oil, DuPont's purchase of Canoco. I'm going to skip over a bunch of these because they're not important, but this is the description of what's happening, right? So it says they were the principal reasons that one out of 10 Yale graduates applied for a job at first Boston in 1986. And that 30% of Harvard business school graduates ended up in the MNA MNA department of the top four firms. That's crazy. The set. And here's why the salaries were phenomenal. A rookie just out of MBA program could easily make 150 to $200,000 a year in 1986 money. A junior partner in the early to mid thirties, uh, in his early, early to mid thirties, excuse me, was making a million and to 2 million a year, a senior partner, two to 3 million a year, and all stars like Wasserstein could get six, seven to 10 million. There was no limit. And eventually he's going to realize that even when he's making 10, 10 million plus that he's still underpaid. And that's when he goes out and starts his own company. And the growth of these MNA departments were really fast. They, they went up, uh, and in first Boston's case under and Wasserstein was, uh, largely credited with this, him and his partner. Uh, it went up 125 X in seven years. So it says the MNA department, they established at first Boston helped the firm to a record $125 million in earnings in 1985, a long way from the million dollars that had earned before MNA gathered its lucrative momentum in 1978. So they made a million in 1978 and 125 million in 1985. That's just one company. Okay. So eventually as Bob builds up steam, allied realizes, Oh no, we, we might get taken over. So what was common at this time was they look for what's called a white night. So if they're like, if we're going to be taken over, let's at least be taken over by somebody that we admire or like somebody that's more like on our side. And so this is about the white night. And then what was surprising is there's this, uh, this guy is really famous for social media. He's got tens of millions of followers on Instagram. His name is Dan Buzarian. Well, his dad is a major character in this book, which again, it's just unbelievable. Uh, so it's got the white night is this guy named Edward D Bartola. Um, he was a man who owned 59 major shopping malls from Florida, California, one 10th of all retail mall space in the country. Uh, he owned the San Francisco 49ers to Pittsburgh penguins and a sizable slice of Ohio. This is more about him. The would be rescue of allied D Baratolo was a courtly octogenarian who works seven days a week. Stylistically, he couldn't have been more different from the, from, uh, from Bob. Uh, he, so there's a description of him. He continued to occupied a modest ranch house in a suburb of Ohio. His favorite restaurant was a friendly neighborhood place that he owned. He never had a facelift or a hair transplant. He had never been to Europe. His idea of a wild time was ordering a Scotch with an orange peel, which he never seemed to finish when his house was being redecorated. D Bartolo could have, who could have gone anywhere, chose to rent a room at the local holiday inn. He owned the local holiday in, he had few extravagances. This was a multi-billionaire who preferred to live the life of an overworked clerk. And so D Bartola is working with Paul Buzarian. Paul Buzarian was the D Bartolo's partner in a number of stock market deals and was instrumental in convincing D Bartola, uh, to do this here. Buzarian subsequently was convicted of criminal charges for unrelated financial transgressions. I can't tell you how many characters in this book. There's this, they're described the same way. Uh, they're doing this deal later on. Uh, five years later, they're in jail. Uh, two years later, this guy got convicted of this. This guy was forced and now it's just, they're all running a foul of various different regulations and laws. It's, it's a wild, wild time and a wild, wild story. This is another example of why I would say Bob would not be somebody, Bob or anybody like Bob is not somebody you want to work with. Eventually he decides he's going to drop Payne Webber because first, first Boston is better and he's really impressed with Wasserstein. So it says first, he's talking to, um, Payne Webber now. He says, first Boston is going to take the lead on this one. You'll be, you'll still be part of the deal. You'll be paid your full fee. Um, a separation agreement stipulating that Payne Webber would be, would receive $6.5 million from Bob for its services was signed by both parties. Bob didn't pay. Uh, he contended that Payne Webber hadn't done anything to deserve the fee and at a meeting set up labor later by the Payne Webber people to resolve the problem, the Bob people didn't show up. Payne Webber had to sue to get its money and eventually the case was settled in Payne Webber's favor. And this is a reminder that Bob is risking a good business for all the shenanigans. First, Boston studied the financial condition of Bob's corporation and looking over these annual reports, as well as private valuation studies, the bankers were impressed with Bob's 700 million, 700 million, that's Canadian dollars, uh, equity in real estate that the Bob, that Bob's properties could serve as collateral in the event of a, of a mishap, such as Bob not being able to pay his takeover bills, which he can't, waited heavily in favor of doing business with him. So they thought, okay, we can do this because we can at least secure it. But again, what's 700, it's not even 700 million. Why it's being much less than that. But, uh, what's 700 million collateral when you, when you're learning the guy, $11 billion, right? Uh, this guy just gets weirder and weirder. This is a, um, uh, a conversation that's happening within side of first Boston. Sit down. You're not going to believe this. Bob's got a fortune teller. Bullshit. How do you know? He just told me himself on the phone, a German fortune teller. He thinks he's destined to take over allied because the fortune teller says so. So, uh, they're, they're still, they're failing to take over allied. He doesn't have enough assets. They, they do this. This is where Wasserstein comes up with a good idea and it winds up with the idea. It winds up being a loophole and it's closed right after this happens. But really the lesson is don't quit until you've tried everything. Um, I mean, I guess it's partial lesson. I guess at this point, like why even try this if it's going to wind up ruining your entire life, which is what it does, but I guess they don't know that yet. Um, so it says no self respecting player could afford to throw in the towel before trying every conceivable last minute ploy and Wasserstein was champion playmaker. This particular ploy was called the street sweep. The idea was to bypass the tender offer process and buy enough shares on the open market to gain immediate control. In allied's case, Wasserstein figured a sweep, a street sweep was possible because of an interesting development. His rivals had overlooked a large percentage of the allied shares had fallen into the hands of a single interested party named Boyd Jeffries. This is another example of a guy that plays a role in this acquisition that winds up going to jail later on Boyd Jeffries is going to make some money, but then he goes to jail later on on unrelated stuff. Let's go more to this idea. It's like three pages in a row. I just jot down unbelievable, unbelievable, unbelievable. This far, neither side had dared to buy the block because the tender with tender and merger offers still on the table. So there's the white knight and Bob all going for allied, right? So those are the two parties. Um, so when you have merger offers still on the table is against the SEC regulations from them to acquire shares in the open market. A judge would surely nullify any purchase of Jeffrey shares and perhaps invalidate the entire tender offer as well. But with Bob flirting with capitulation, Wasserstein had a wild thought. What if Bob would drew his tender offer, then turned around and grabbed the Jeffries block a minute later. It's kind of a loophole, right? Tech. It's in the, it's a, it's technically legal, but against the spirit of the regulation. That's why the SEC closes the loophole and doesn't allow this after this, this goes through the combination of the Jeffrey shares and the shares he already owned would give Bob more than 51%. Bob would then force a second merger transaction in which he'd buy the remainder of the stock because now he owns 51%, right? Uh, Finkelstein was invited to first Boston to describe the possible ramifications. So that's the attorney he's meeting with Wasserstein and say, okay, what's wrong with my idea? Uh, including a worst case scenario. So they're, they're mapping out worst case scenario. Uh, can't Bob buys the block for 1.8 billion. A disapproving judge refuses to let Bob vote these shares. So even though Bob technically owns a majority, he's barred from running the company. This is all hypothetical by the way, it doesn't actually happen with Bob's takeover and threat. Now neutralized D bar Tola pulls his offer from the table. The price of allied stock plummets. Uh, Bob is stuck with millions of shares. He can't unload except that a huge loss and the people who lent him the 1.8 billion member, he doesn't have the money for this. The people who lent him the 1.8 billion in cash to do the street sweep want their money back. Bob can only repay part of it. His Canadian real estate is liquidated and he's forced into bankruptcy. Other than that, everything is fine. And now here's a problem. Another question is who would lend Bob $1.8 billion to do this? Wasserstein suggests that first Boston bypass city core and lend him the money for the street sweep. Earlier, first Boston had committed itself to making Bob the a $455 million bridge loan, a daring step in itself. So they go from making money on fees to now trying to make money on fees and loans and investments. This is what's going to cause them to go under. Wasserstein winds up extracting himself personally, right? So he's not personally liable, but the company winds up bearing the brunt of this because we already know Bob's going to go into bankruptcy, right? Now, why would first Boston agree to this? Here's the problem. Wasserstein was coasting first Boston farther towards the edge of prudence and the firm wouldn't see and the firm that wouldn't see Bob the previous summer was now on the verge of investing in this uncertain ploy. First Boston's management may have resented what they perceived to be Wasserstein's smart ass attitude, but his M&A department made 90% of the profits. And if Wasserstein wanted to do a street sweep, he could do a street sweep. So he technically, Wasserstein has more power than the CEO of first Boston. Also, the executive committee was convinced that Bob had enough real estate assets to cover the downside. He didn't. A liquidation would be tough luck for Bob, but not for the firm. The upside, why are they doing this? Not only does Wasserstein telling him to do this and he represents 90% of the profits, but the upside was that first Boston would make over $100 million in extra fees, not to mention the interest on the bridge loan. So it was that first Boston gave its official assent to betting 100% of its entire corporate capital on Bob, the new flaky Canadian real estate developer and a liar who is doing this deal because his fortune teller tells him it's going to work out. So let me go back to that idea that Bob was flirting with capitulation. There was this comment at the time called green mailing. And so they're like, hey, if you'll go away, we'll buy the stock that you already own and we'll give you like another 60 million on top of that. He could have made, I think it was something between 60 and 100 million, 60 and 80 million maybe just to go away. And so that's what they talk about. He's thinking about capitulation and this is the other side. And so they're going back and forth about, hey, we should just do this. That way D Bartola gets it. And they're advised against it because of Paul Buzarian. So it says, Frank had been trying to get D Bartolo to agree to the severance package, but D Bartola had deferred to Buzarian and Buzarian had bought because he didn't know about the sweet sweep, right? Watch the scene's idea. Now at 9 a.m. Buzarian was commenting on the news that had just come over the financial wires. Bob had dropped his tender offer. Did you see this? He yelled to Frank. Bob has given up. He's done. Finished. Withdrawn his tender offer. And you suckers at Allied wanted us to pay him $60 million to get rid of him. What a waste of money that would have been. He's gone. History. Out of the picture. We didn't need to pay him anything to get rid of him. He's oh my God. Buzarian had seen the second message on the financial wire. Bob had bought 25 million shares of Allied stock from Boyd Jeffries. He was now the majority shareholder. So I called Bob a liar earlier. This is why. Because he kept saying, I'm going to put up money when I kept putting up money, but he kept getting these. He pushes the financial institutions further than they want to go. And then as they get deeper, he says, oh, did you change my mind? Now you got to figure it out. So it says, and now in addition to everything else, after City Corps had agreed to loan Bob 150 million to solve half of his equity problem. Remember, he said he was going to put up 300 million, right? Bob was telling the bank he couldn't produce the other half. So I'm going to give you three. I'm going to put up 300 million. OK, just kidding. I only have 150 million. You lend me the 150. Oh, you lend me the 150. Now guess what? I don't have the other 150. This guy's terrible. He was relying on the baker's forbearance and ingenuity to come up with that, too. Bob understood that City Corps and First Boston, who together had invested 1.8 billion in the street sweep and who were going to make hundreds of millions of fees if the deal closed, was not about to let the deal fall apart because Bob didn't pony up his equity. They had more of a vested interest in the deal than he did. So let's go and let's talk more about the fees, fees, then more fees and more fees. It's crazy. Potentially was the most lucrative deal in history for First Boston from its growing list of Bob's fees. I'm just going to list off a bunch of them. OK, eventually we'll total them up at the end. 1.5 million for the initial commitment. Seven million dollar acquisition fee. A million for issuing a highly confident letter. Seven million for the original bridge loan commitment. An additional 3.6 million for increasing the bridge commitment. How the hell is Bob ever going to make money out of a business like this when he's giving away hundreds of millions of dollars in fees? 50 million for the sweepstreet loan. More and more fees coming from the junk bond financing. For City, that was First Boston. For Citibank, the takeover was just as lucrative. The closing fee of 1%. The initial commitment fee of three million dollars. The syndication fee of eight million dollars. An agency fee of a million dollars. The commitment fee of 1% per year on the unused portion of the loan. The bridge loan fee for its half of the street sweep and so on and so on. So this is just, this is just for the first acquisition. Remember he does two. It was a 4.1 billion dollar acquisition was the final cost. Including a whopping 612 million dollars in fees, expenses, and finance charges. So a few weeks ago we talked about how in the early days of SpaceX, Elon Musk would insist on interviewing the first 3,000 employees for SpaceX. Wanted to make sure like he was, he had the most talented people. Bob will have a conversation with somebody for a few minutes. He says, you'll do fine after having asked him just a few questions. And then the guy his name is Rick's fine for what? I'm hiring you a senior vice president of real estate. Okay. So after a week on the job, he was hired as senior vice president of real real estate. After just a few questions, they're on Bob's jet and he says, I want you to be the president. Rick's could hardly believe what he was hearing. He'd been on the job only a few days and was certainly no expert in retailing. That's how Bob's going to make his hiring decisions. This guy's insane. Later in 1987, this is just what a few months after Bob and Riggs had a falling out. This resulted from an argument Bob was having with the owner of a shopping mall in Massachusetts. The owner wanted an allied store. This is a member after I already took over allied, an allied store to anchor his mall. But Bob refused to cooperate unless he got a 50% equity interest in the mall as compensation. This demand was rejected by the owner as preposterous, but Bob somehow got it into his head that the owner had agreed to the terms when the imaginary deal fell apart. For in truth, there was never a deal. Bob blamed me for screwing up the negotiations. He blew up at me and called me stupid. Okay. So some of the idea that they had about taking over allied is, okay, we got to figure out how to, we had to pay all, I think a couple hundred million in interest on all the debt that we borrowed. And so we're going to sell off a bunch of divisions, right? And there's a lot, I have three separate notes all filled up on this page. Cause there's a lot of things that came to mind when I was reading this and really emotion blurs judgment. And this is, this is again, Bob's not the only idiot in this story. There's tons of people that are buying assets that are just, they're overpaying for assets. So allied is selling off their worst stores and yet there's like acquisition fever at this time. So every other retailer thinks they just have to keep buying shit because other people are buying things. So it says where there was little apparent interest, they did their best to stimulate it by creating the illusion of competition. The idea was to convince a likely buyer, which they call a live one, that other interested parties were ready to bid on whatever division he was thinking of buying and then to scare him into making a generous preemptive offer. Give us your price now they would say, and we'll shut down the auction process when this ploy worked. First Boston was elated. That's who's doing this for a Bob. Okay. And one of the most spectacular examples of overbidding for an allied division, the crown American company was panicked into making a ridiculously high preemptive bid for this company called Millers. Millers was a second rate franchise for which first Boston expected to get $75 to $80 million at most crown America had wanted to buy Kane Sloan. So that's another franchise, but Dillard wind up winning that bid. So crown Americans, this is why I say motion blurs judgment, crown Americans management became desperate to buy Millers. So, okay, I lost out on what I really wanted. I have to buy something to, to, to their amazement crown American shut down the auction process on Millers with a bid of $95 million. The guy that's doing this negotiation for first Boston's behalf says I was struggling to keep a straight face. This is like the opposite. So what I thought of when I, um, there's a great, I covered the book, uh, Jim Clayton, it's called a first a dream. I think it might be founders number 91. And it's this book, uh, Warren Buffett read the book and then buys the, buys the company guy starts off. If I remember correctly, selling like, uh, car dealerships, then realizes he starts selling like mobile. I think it goes to the, uh, I think called mobile homes. What are they called? Uh, manufactured homes, uh, largest producer in America then winds up getting into, he finds it very lucrative in the financing of these homes. But anyways, he retires at this point to his son is the one that has to, um, is the one that's negotiating Warren Buffett. And if I remember correctly, he says something like, okay, Warren calls him up. So, okay, I'll give you $12 a share. And the son is like, you know, I went to the board. Let me, we said 16 goes back to Warren, it just goes back to Warren says 16, right? These are approximate numbers. I don't have it in front of me, but this is how I remember, uh, Warren Buffett says 12. Okay. 14, 12. Okay. 12 words. Like I don't, I don't bid. Like this is, I've already worked out what I'm going to pay for it, except it or not. And he winds up getting it for 12. This is the, again, Warren, brilliant, intelligent, smart, the people running crown America, the opposite, right? These are the anti-patterns that we see here. Um, this, another one was, this is a, now another example of this. I'm going to exclude the company and the people cause it doesn't matter. They do, uh, this one bid 95 million, the next highest offer. The only other offer turned out to be $60 million, $60 million. And so there's a, there's a footnote in the book later. And I went and put it back on this page because it, whatever. My name is says in only a minority of cases, did the allied divisions add to anyone's prosperity except the bankruptcy lawyers. And so a lot of these people that are overbidding, if you overbid by $35 million or something, and who even knows if it's worth 60 million to begin with, what do you think's going to happen? Another note, I left myself. Time is the best filter. There are several people in this book who are described as wealthy. I looked them up after, and they all went bankrupt. And a lot of these companies that overbid for these second rate allied divisions wind up failing as well. You can't be a poor steward of your resources and expect to survive. Okay. So eventually Bob tries to recruit some other people that had retail experience to run his company. He's going to recruit this one guy. There's a, there's a small story I want to tell you that I found interesting because he's recruiting this guy named Moroski, Moroski and Moroski's partners with Wexner, who is the founder of limited. And there's another crazy like a postscript to his story too. So they said they kept in constant touch. We were like brothers who, who could read each other's thoughts. So it's talking about the relationship between Moroski and the older Wexner, right? Wexner is the founder. Moroski is the guy is like his second in command in 1987. They had a spat. The spat originated in what else? A difference of opinion about takeovers. Wexner he says was intent on taking over something. Moroski was opposed to these acquisitions. What did they need them for? Especially at the prices that people were paying for the ego trip of owning vanity stores that were losing money. And that's another thing. A lot of people are buying these companies or tens of millions of dollars companies, spending tens of millions rather on these companies. And they're, a lot of them aren't even profitable. The purpose of business is profit, not a platform for your ego. Moroski told Wexner he worried that an ill conceived and overpriced acquisition would have an unpleasant side effect on the value of limited stock where his personal, fortunately, and I think they had worked together for like two decades. The Wexner brought nothing from allied. He did buy Henry Bendell. This exasperated his differences with Moroski, who reminded himself that Bendell had been losing money for several years. Moroski told his old friend and partner that he was quitting. A few days later, Moroski returned to the office to clean out his desk. This was no longer possible. The desk had disappeared in rubble. Wexner had had the place bulldozed. Humans are crazy, man. As Moroski stood in the midst of the destruction, it occurred to him that Wexner had been more upset than he had anticipated. Wexner also terminated the lifetime discount at all limited stores that he had extended to Moroski's wife. He and Moroski never spoke again. So there's two interesting postscripts to Wexner. Wexner, he also made really intelligent acquisitions. He bought, Wexner bought Victoria's Secret for a million dollars. Who knows? I think that brand on its own is probably worth a couple billion today, right? Now that's the positive. The negative thing, you know who Wexner's financial manager was starting in 1987 when Moroski left? Jeffrey Epstein. Moving on, I mentioned earlier that there's a ton of examples in this book of people substituting someone else's thinking for their own. Lesson here is you got to think for yourself. Up here says the Toronto security analyst. People were amazed by what had happened in New York. The Pavilion viewpoint was that if Wall Street and all its geniuses would lend Bob billions of dollars, there must be something to it. Wall Street, many Canadians decided, must know something about this guy that we didn't. So Bob had no trouble, and this is after borrowing what is he up to? $8 billion or $11 billion. I forgot how much is up until this point he's borrowed. So Bob had no trouble in obtaining a $150 million personal loan to buy back his own stock, secured in part by real estate, but mostly by the value of the stock itself. The National Bank of Canada was taking a major gamble on Bob's vision, and they took that gamble because they said, hey, well, Wall Street's, these guys seem to be smart. They must know what they're doing. So here's $150 million. And we see the overconfidence that Bob has in himself in thinking that things will just work out in the future, which he says there's always some way, causes him to vastly overpay. So this is actually, I was wrong. We haven't got to the point where he finished allied yet. This is him, or not, he's done allied. We haven't done federated. And so this is where they're going, and the price keeps going up. And so let me just read the section two. Bob raised his price once again to $66 per share to put more pressure on the board. An official press release listing Bob's new improved lineup of equity partners was put out. Bob had managed to round up $1.2 billion in equity. Who would quibble with that? The fact that most of this was borrowed money, and therefore not true equity was bothersome to Ron. Ron is working, one of the guys that works for Bob, who could see the dangers of loans piled on loans. I told him that although from federated point of view, this might be equity, that it was borrowed and that long term, we could have a problem. Bob said, don't worry. He thrived on leverage. It's in this. So he says, don't worry. Then description of him is striving on leverage. And then he says, this is now another quote from Bob. If somebody lends you a dollar, you take it. The ramifications can be handled later. There's always some way out. Let's go back to more of these ridiculous decisions by people made, not named Bob. And I cannot believe he wants to selling, he owns Brooks Brothers now. And he wants to selling it. Look at this. This is unbelievable. When we heard that Bob was flying to London to meet with Lord Rainer and sell Brooks Brothers for $750 million, our immediate reaction was, sure Bob, nobody around here thought he'd get more than 450 million. Bob negotiating with Lord Rainer was Bob at its best. In a face to face negotiation with an eager buyer, he never blinked first, gave no hint of compromise, stuck to his price with such passionate conviction that to his adversary, it began to seem reasonable. There seemed to be no choice but to accept Bob's price or walk away empty handed. So he gets $750 million for something other people thought he could only sell for 450 million. So Bob is bidding against Macy's for federated. His first bid was 47. Now we just saw him bump it up to 66. Right. The bidding continued to pace with Bob's bump to $77 a share. He has no idea if this is going to make money. Just like, I'm going to get it. Macy bumped to 77.50 and it just keeps going. And then again to 79. Neither Bob nor Macy's showed any sign of backing down. At each higher level, the number crunchers due to, this is such an important sentence. At each higher level, the number crunchers dutifully produced another computer simulation to prove the deal made sense. So why are they doing that? Because the higher the deal goes, the more fees they're going to reap. So Charlie Munger wisely told us, whose bread I eat, his song I sing. It's like asking a barber if you need a haircut. What do you think he's going to say? It's an example of how Bob's a lunatic with poor follow through. Hearing that the problem with, he always has meetings in his hotel room, which is really creepy to me ever since the Harvey Weinstein stuff came out too, right? Hearing that the problem with Ann Taylor was not as simple as revising things. Hey, let's just spruce up the catalog. Everything will be fine. Again, this guy knows nothing about retail. Hearing that the problem with Ann Taylor was not as simple as revising the catalog, sent Bob into a rage. He picked up his fork and stabbed the table. The fork penetrated the table and was vibrating back and forth. And I'll never forget it. Looking at that fork vibrating there and this guy's eyes bulging wide and his hands shaking. And I looked at this poor woman. This is a group of four people. One of them is the president of Ann Taylor. Her name is Michelle Fortune. I looked at this poor woman, Michelle Fortune, and thought she was going to have a heart attack. And then I saw the look on the other faces and I wondered who was going to have the first heart attack in the room. Bob ran around in a circle, circled the table once, then twice. Then he stopped and sat down, took a couple of deep breaths and apologized. In closing, Bob said he wanted a full report on the Ann Taylor situation at the forthcoming meeting. Fortune wasn't sure what sort of report to produce, so she decided to wait for further instructions. But there was no further instructions. There was no forthcoming meeting. Bob never called back. More poor follow through, more this idea that his the last idea he ever heard is the best idea. He hires Moroski, that guy I told you that was with Partners with Wexner. And he's going to let him be CEO of both Allied and Federated, changes his mind, decides he's going to do it. So he says, and he tells Moroski, he's like, no, I'm not, I can't accept that. Like, I'm not, that's not what you hired me for. And then a few months later, more fees, as I know I left myself. Bob paid Moroski the balance of his contract, $3 million for six months work. It was supposed to be, I think, a million dollars a year at three years, right? So he pays him $3 million for six months work, plus an estimated $200,000 more of stock options. I want to go back to this, this terrible idea of relying on models. So for the Federated deal to work, the model had one assumption stacked on another stacked on another assumption stacked on another assumption that all had to go exactly as planned. Because there's no room for error here. Because that room for error is taken up by a gargantuan amount of fees. Check this out. Such was the Federated deal as it appeared on paper, all would be well, the number crunchers predicted provided, of course, that the divisions on the block sold for the expected high prices, that Bob would take out the Federated mortgages, the Federated budget would be kind of thinking about all these crazy assumptions that have to go exactly precise. This is insane. The divisions on the block would sold would be sold for exactly the high prices they they expected that Bob would take out the Federated mortgages, or that he could get it, the Federated budget would be cut on schedule, etc, etc. Interesting enough, City Corps, which had put on the financing package together wasn't taking this bet. This is going to remind you of if you ever read the big short 2008 2009 financial crisis, as it worked to syndicate the Federated deal and to form a permanent bank group city go City Corps also a situational Lee, I can never pronounce that word laid off its own part of the loans, so they would end up with practically no ongoing exposure. That's the most important part. Those three words no ongoing exposure to Federated after it booked its big fees. Who could resist the wonderful procession of fees 1.5 million for being a deal manager another million for being high highly confident junk bond letter another 1.8 this is going to sound just like the allied deal right that I read to you earlier except except now Federated is twice as large twice as many fees another 1.8 1 1.85 million for a highly confident bank letter 4.5 million for a willingness to commit letter 2 million for the equity bridge commitment 15 million dollars in fees for the junk bridge commitment 20 dot this is how complicated the deal is 20 million dollars for the funding of the junk bridge 10.5 million for M&A advisory work 38 million on the interest on their loan 17.6 million in profits for from the spread on the junk bond deal 15 million in divestiture fees this is insane that you would ever agree to this plus a few other fees and general interest charges producing a grand total of 130 million dollars plus expenses and that's only for first boston add that to the city core fees pain weber uh the other company drek soul kidder and p body p body all of which were paid by bob for the privilege of acquiring federated the result exceeded 200 million more in fees and charges than the entire federated and all its stores nationwide earned in a year so if he bought something poorly he's run his his life poorly up into this point what is the what is the chance that he's going to run the combination of allied and federated well it's not going to happen right and this is just there's a million examples here's just another example he's a sloppy mess this guy so says bob had flown into atlanta bob and now he's meeting with two uh two of the divisions that he owns which is riches and what's the other one called uh goldsmiths okay so says uh and he's very wasteful too i i hate his like his his obsession with opulence bob had flown into the Atlanta to Atlanta he was met by a dutiful contingent of executives this guy named zimmernitz so says bob and the richest contingent that's the one company he's going to visit got into one limousine to drive to the downtown store while a second limo was dispatched with bob's clothes the guy packed so much that he when he lands somewhere he needs two limos one to go where he's going and the second to go for his clothes how wasteful is this so he gets in the car and tells zimmerman again last idea is the best idea i want to merge riches with goldsmiths he said right away that's impossible said zimmerman get them on the phone commanded bob referring to the two heads of goldsmiths and we'll see zimmerman were reluctant to broach the sensitive subject with dire implications for the management of goldsmiths from a car phone look if you want to talk to them then you talk to them zimmerman told bob but i don't think this is the proper time bob told zimmerman to dial the number as there was no time like the present and bob himself talked to the two heads of goldsmith and instructed them to fly to atlanta that very night so they could work out a merger of goldsmiths into riches fearing that they were about to be given an axe and this is why you see why i said i just i i would i hate that these type of people exist he's passed away now but they still exist they just they treat other humans terribly and i always when i when i run across these people one i want to know that they exist and the reason i want to know that they exist is for the the second point is that i want to make sure that i'm not on i don't i'm not doing business with them i want to make sure i'm never on this side of the transaction i never put myself in a position where i can be what i do and where i how i make a living and where i'm at is is reliant on people like bob and unfortunately these psychopathic sociopathic delusions of grandeur having people can have the ability to work themselves into positions of power let's go back to this so it says they were their fear they were about to be fired so the two men hopped on a plane for atlanta checked into a hotel where the new boss was staying as bob bob had gone out to a dinner party they waited nervously in their rooms for his call i just feel so bad for these guys by 11 30 having received no word from bob they phoned Zimmerman at home to ask what became of this urgent meeting where the hell is he they said Zimmerman said he assumed that the meeting with bob had already taken place maybe he forgot Zimmerman suggested bob admitted as much when zimmer finally reached him in his hotel room we can discuss goldsmiths later bob said think about what a jerk what an asshole move this is make me like i have to leave my family hop on a plane at your bidding i have to go fly to you because this this murder has to be done right away and then you probably go out and get drunk at a at a dinner party and say oh no forget it we'll do this later it's inconsiderate Zimmerman politely reminded bob that two top managers had been summoned to atlanta for what they'd been led to believe was an emergency session and that having come this far they'd appreciate a response from him in person bob agreed and invited the heads of goldsmiths up to his suite bob opened the door in his underwear and announced goldsmiths will be merged into riches and then bid them good night so shortly after that both allied and federated are pushed into bankruptcy and that should be no surprise i i did fail to mention there's there's a bunch of stories in the book where he did this even before he was into real estate anytime he would close art not real estate into retailing even back in his real estate career let's say he closed on a building he started a new project he would insist on throwing a party and then he was obsessed with self-engrandizement and so like he threw events so you could celebrate how great he is this is not an exaggeration he did the same thing with allied when he closed allied he's like okay he told first boss and other people was like uh you know send invitations out to new york's best business people invite them to this party that's celebrating me no one would show up so they had they went about staffing the party and faking it with a bunch of people that actually work for the bank so this again he's not doing this because he actually gives a shit about building a great business or a great product he doesn't care about that he just wants you to idolize him he's doing this all to be idolized and it's just not that's a again we go back to warren buffett's idea about inner scorecard versus outer scorecard which i think is such a powerful idea it's like the key to happy life is to have an inner scorecard to make sure that the decisions you're making you're doing them because you're satisfied with them not making decisions because you hope to get prestige or adulation from outside parties it's just not a way to live your life and and bob is a complete outer scorecard person and now we get to the part where he's like why reading this book it's valuable in setting bankruptcies because this idea is like you know going back to charlie monger idea tell me where i'm dying so i won't go there just realizing hey if i just do the opposite of bob i'm way ahead of the curve but this is why i have a distaste for who he was as a person because he hurt thousands and thousands of people and he didn't seem to care at all so it says the 50,000 creditors from a single bankruptcy filing is a record in financial history the number includes bud coneym alberto rubino and george grossman this is these are thousand these are small business owners that are supplying all these various stores with sometimes it's fabric sometimes they're actually the ones making the house brand everything else again these are not people flying around bob's jet had a gold-plated toilet these are people just trying to provide jobs for their families for other people this you know moderately successful people and he's stiffing them one of them makes the example he's like i just sent 30,000 dresses to to bob he never paid for them but yet if i go back in the store and take them back i'd be arrested for stealing he's like how is what he did not stealing so this is where again it's just the value here is just to be anti bob's the 50,000 creditors from single bankruptcy filing is record financial history the number includes several of these small business owners plus thousands of other vendors and merchandisers plus bankers real estate companies factories bond holders and the irs which were seeking 600 million in federal income taxes from bob bob's efforts to insulate one asset from another and to maximize every advantage had backfired in a sad and spectacular way at the end of his two glorious leverage buyouts he himself had suffered their fate his various possessions sold off for cash his real estate empire dismantled his his bob corporation shares which in 1988 were worth 500 million were reduced to 10 million dollars by 1989 his debts far exceeded these assets his net worth was less than zero the banks forced the bank sued to force him into involuntary personal bankruptcy in may 1991 his own company sued him for 12.7 million dollars and asked him to return paintings and cars 50 5200 dollars worth of telephone equipment that was in his toronto chateau the company also said it would no longer pay the salaries for his chauffeur and his household staff or his travel bills and club memberships in march his lawyers informed the bond holders and other litigants that bob would not be coming to court or giving depositions on the advice of his physician rumors were rampant that he had had another nervous breakdown and that is where i'll leave it for the full story by the book the the author did a great job of eliciting an emotional response from the reader and i think that is going to prevent me from forgetting the cautionary tale of bob for a long time so if you want the full
