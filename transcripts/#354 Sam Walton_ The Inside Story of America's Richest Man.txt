He was not nationally known He says he was in the shadows. He was off the beaten track just building his incredible business empire And so by the time the Forbes 400 list has come around Sam has already built this 6.3 billion dollar fortune and so the book opens with all these reporters in the early 1980s descending on Bentonville, Arkansas to try to figure out who Sam Walton is and how he accumulated such a massive fortune and then in Their research they give a great overview of his life And so it says he grew up in Missouri in the Depression He worked his way through college lived a clean Christian life served stateside in World War two married an Oklahoma banker's daughter Opened up his first five and dime store in Backwater, North Central, Arkansas and raised four healthy kids And then this is my favorite part of this entire section pretty darn ordinary But only on the surface Sam Walton underneath was no ordinary man He was a genius in business with an iron mind and unwilling to compromise any of his carefully thought out principles and One of the most remarkable things about Sam is just how simple his idea really was and he says it's a very simple idea I'm going to buy cheap. I'm gonna sell low. I'm gonna do that every day I'm gonna do it with a smile and focus on service and one of the benefits that Sam Walton had early in his career was That there's a tendency for people to confuse a simple idea with an ordinary person and Charlie Munger who extensively Studied Sam Walton hit upon why a simple idea taken very seriously is so powerful in business Charlie said in business we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing and are minimizing one or a few variables and So most of what I want to talk to you about today It's just how long it took Sam to find his path and how messy it was at the beginning of you know One of the greatest businesses that has ever been created. I read A little while ago that if you take his family's net worth today It's it's almost a quarter of a trillion dollars And yet it took Sam Walton 20 years of experimenting inside of retailing did before he the rushes about That's the word he uses and finds the idea slowly, but surely through trial and error finds the idea that turns into Walmart But before I get there I just want to point out a few things that happen in his childhood that I think gives you an idea of the kind of There's a few traits that appear in his early life that he never lets go of a sense of duty He's extremely disciplined and then he had unbelievable levels of endurance And so this is a description of Sam when he was in high school Sam was going out for football and basketball learning to play tennis making A's and friends grinding away on merit badges in hopes of becoming an Eagle Scout regularly attending Sunday school and Working odd jobs such as mowing the grass and delivering newspapers. He was following the example of his dad His dad had a life motto that could not be more simple It is only three words and it's the same word over and over again work work work His dad taught his sons that you were supposed to have a fierce work ethic He would not tolerate any of his sons not being industrious. They had to be industrious They had to be ambitious and they had to be decent people And so here's a little more about Sam in high school and it goes back to this idea that Do not confuse a simple idea with an ordinary person. He was quarterback of the undefeated football team. He lettered in basketball He was president of the student body. He was awarded the superlative the most versatile boy He was in every club and organization and he was active The description continues. He was a hard worker. He was optimistic. He felt that the world was something that he could conquer He didn't waste time. He was always busy doing something and that's something that he's gonna continue for his entire career The fact that he's always working he hated wasting time and he's intolerant of slowness And I don't think you can understand Sam Walton until you understand the effect that the Great Depression Had on Sam he grew up in the Great Depression. He was born in 1918 and so he's old enough to see the effects the financial effects and it actually leads to his parents divorce Which is obviously very rare at that time that time period and he talks a little bit about seeing his father struggle through this time He says my father quit the mortgage company and went into business for himself in the real estate and insurance industry Then came the depression dad's business went down the drain and so then his dad is moving the family around looking for opportunity And yet for the next ten years, this is the prime of his father's life. They make no economic progress They are distinctly lower middle class right hovering around the poverty line And so Sam and his brother bud get jobs to try to help out the family and there's a line in the book To understanding the kind of personality that Sam had and he said the depression was a big leveler of people Sam chose to rise above it He was determined to be a success and so when I was reading this section what immediately popped into my mind is one of my Favorite ideas it comes from Paul Graham and he was asking what is the better predictor of? Company success success in business is a determination or is it intelligence and Paul's answer to this is incredible He says it turns out it is much more important to be determined than smart if you imagine this hypothetical person that is 100 out of 100 for smart and 100 out of 100 for determination and then you start taking away Determination it doesn't take very long until you have this ineffectual but brilliant person Whereas if you take someone who is super determined and you take away smartness Eventually you get to a guy who owns a lot of taxi medallions or a trash hauling business, but it's still rich It is important to note it only takes one person on the founding team to be super determined and the reason I bring that up And the reason I think is really important and especially in this section is because okay We see he's got this fierce work ethic, right? He is determined to be a success He is not going to allow his family to hover over the poverty line Think about how insane if you were mapping out this I was thinking about this this morning if you were mapping out the Family tree and the trajectory the economic trajectory of the Walton family before Sam Walton comes on the scene You would see middling success and then all of a sudden there's this one data point this generational inflection point We're just skyrocket today that family present day a hundred years after Sam Walton was born You know, they have a quarter of a trillion dollars two hundred fifty billion dollars But a hundred years ago, they were straddling the poverty line The difference was one person this super determined person made that difference He changed the trajectory of his entire family for generations And so it starts with determination, but in this hypothetical situation, it's not that we have to remove points for intelligence It took Sam to find where he can be intelligent What is the field that he can be the most intelligent if you have a list of the greatest retailers of all time? Sam Walton has to be at the top of that list and the reason I recommend if you haven't read his autobiography Get it immediately get the audiobook at the paperback whatever you have to do and then if you've already read that book by this book because you will see it took decades of him applying its determination and then matching it with 100 of 100 intelligence in a specific field and It's important to understand. This was not planned out. Sam had no idea. He had one idea One idea of what his future career could be when he was around college age He's like maybe I should be president of the United States. That's another personality trait that he has He's gonna aim straight to the top. He has to be I think he calls it being like the top of the heap or the top Of the pile. He's just that has this a ruthless competitive drive as well But he did not have this dream to be a retailer when he was a boy He stumbled into it. And so let's go there right now. He actually gets a job at JC penny This is an extremely important turning point in his life You're gonna see a lot of the lessons that he's gonna learn from JC penny He applies later on to Walmart And so let me just tell you that like in case you don't know Like this shocked me because I knew what JC penny was it was around when I was a kid I don't even know if they exist anymore But in 1940 right where we are in the story JC penny has almost 1600 stores and they're doing 300 million a year in revenue and the founder is still actively involved even though he's in his 60s His name is John cash penny. Sam is actually gonna meet John and get a lesson directly from him. So Sam gets this job He's being paid $85 a month remember that for this upcoming story about sharing incentives with store managers Which I'll get to in one second but the first idea I have to point out to you that Sam's gonna use for Walmart is the fact that the company strength that JC Penny had built 1600 stores Avoiding big cities is exactly what Sam's gonna do for Walmart and he focused on Small towns you're talking about towns of 2,000 people 6,000 people 8,000 people that's the first idea It's like oh, maybe there's a lot of more business out in these small towns And we thought the second idea John JC of JC penny is constantly in the stores He's traveling around in the stores wanting to know what's going on Sam does this his entire life and it is one of these store visits to the store that Sam is Working in Sam's around 22 years old at the time that he gets this lesson from this wiser more successful Retail legend he's 65 years old says the customer came in and bought something from Sam and while he wrapped it up for her JC penny was observing the transaction closely. I finished wrapping and tying the package and the lady left then mr. Penny came over boys He said I want to show you something and he took a box about the same size and went around it with paper and let It overlap maybe a quarter of an inch Then he went around it with twine one time like this and one time like that and he tied it He said boys, you know, we don't make a dime out of the merchandise We only make our profit out of the paper and string we save This idea of watching your cost 24-7 of making sure you're ruthlessly Efficient is an idea that Sam Walton holds on to for the rest of his life There's a lot of things in Sam's autobiography that I absolutely love that he said and this is one of my favorite things that he Said in the autobiography that I think relates to the story that we're learning right now He says you can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation Or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you're too inefficient So that is the second thing he learned from his time at JCPenney. Here's the third his direct manager this guy named Duncan He said he was a fantastic trainer He used to invite us to his house every Sunday to play ping-pong and to eat and talk we'd talk about business Of course, you could learn a lot. He was one of the managers who had a 25% bonus contract again another idea Sam is directly gonna steal at the very beginning of Walmart He sets up all his managers and gives him 25% of the profits of the store And remember I said that at this time Sam is making $85 a month his manager shows him the 25% bonus check it was for $65,000 this is Sam's response He waived that around and that made us run faster and work harder Sam Walton's time working at JCPenney and applying what he learned there would eventually put a few billion dollars into his own cash register So I want to get into where Sam buys his first store where he gets the money from he is 27 years old He marries a woman from Oklahoma named Helen. They both have this desire. They're small town people So they're looking around where they're gonna live and where they're gonna live. They're gonna try to buy a Ben Franklin store So they're called Ben Franklin five and dimes the way I would think about this now is Like the modern-day equivalent would be like the dollar store The reason they were called five and dimes because most of the things that you buy there are you know You can get for a nickel or a dime and so Sam and Helen are going around looking for a small town Where they can raise their kids and Sam could have his store This is the very beginning of his retail empire Sam is 27 years old And so they stumble upon this a little town in Arkansas called Newport There is a Ben Franklin franchise now keep in mind at the very beginning for like 20 years of his life Sam Walton is a franchisee of a much larger company and we'll get there in a little bit But it's crazy. He tried to give the idea for Walmart to Ben Franklin to the big corporation they laughed him out of the room and so 27 year old Sam finds a store the town there's 4,000 people that live in Newport They say tiny tiny town that he can buy the Ben Franklin franchise. It's gonna cost him $25,000. He does not have $25,000 so his Father-in-law is going to be very important in their lives, which I'll get to later His father-in-law is very successful as a lawyer a rancher banker And so he loans Sam Walton the $25,000 needed to buy the Ben Franklin franchise and at this time Sam's plan is very simple He's like, well, I'm just gonna take the obsession with customer satisfaction that JC penny had and I'm just gonna apply it to my own Little five and dime store and so he's trying to figure out ways to like drum up business And this is the first sign of something that Sam's a showman. He's like you're very much like a PT Barnum He's got the charisma of a southern preacher and so he's constantly experimenting with these less conventional Ways to attract more customers into the store and you wouldn't believe how some of these like really simple ideas were so effective So he bought he spent a bunch of money on an ice cream machine people What did what the hell you doing? This is like it's a crazy idea and he put it out in front of his store and on the weekends Families and all the farmers and all the people in this rural area They would mob his ice creams his ice cream machine and then some of them would come into the store and then turn into customers Then he'd obsess over their customer satisfaction So then he'd make sure they return and then if they return they're gonna tell other people and so, you know Five and a half years from now when he loses this store. It is by far the most successful I think he's tied for first in all the Ben Franklin franchisees if not if I'm not mistaken So he's like, oh the ice cream worked. What else can I do? Then he buys a popcorn machine does the same thing puts out the popcorn same exact thing happens He's like, oh there's different ways to draw attention to the store then just by saying hey, you know 50% offer buy one get one free He's finding another way to attract customers and even if I only converts a small percentage of the people that buy ice cream The people buy the popcorn it's still a great return on the investment for buying a popcorn machine and ice cream machine And that's something that Sam's gonna repeat. He really felt one of his his best advantages was consistent Around-the-clock customer satisfaction says the most important discovery Sam Walton made in Newport Was that there was a charm and satisfaction in retailing that he had not fully expected He was crazy about selling and about satisfying customers So customer satisfaction satisfying customers repeated over and over again throughout the book the way I would think about this is that Sam's Satisfying customers is Jeff Bezos's Obsessed over customers. It's the same exact idea You and I have talked about this many times in the past if you read about the earliest Amazon Jeff Bezos is going around Handing out highlighted copies of Sam's autobiography for the early employees at Amazon the life and career of Sam Walton had a huge influence over how Jeff Bezos built Amazon in the early days and so Sam Walton's Ben Franklin store was a smashing success and Then we're gonna see something that that happens over and over again that opportunity is a strange beast It frequently appears after a loss. He's running this thing for five and a half years. He gets sales up to 225,000 a year no other store in Newport was performing like this and that catches the eye of his landlord And so this I consider one of the most important decisions of his entire life because at 32 years old Sam Walton is gonna lose everything and be forced to start over again and it is because of an inexperienced kind of rookie mistake when he bought the store He didn't read the lease close enough and he did not have the option to renew and so Sam is meeting with his attorney and his Attorney is telling him what's taking place. It's no good I hope to God the next time you take over a lease from somebody you check to make certain it contains a proper renewal clause They're not gonna let you keep the store The plain truth is they want to run the Ben Franklin in that building You've shown the whole town what a moneymaker can be his attorney watched the color drain out of Sam's face It looks like you're finished. The attorney said the lawyer This is one of my favorite parts of this entire book. The lawyer saw Sam clenching and unclenching his fist Staring at his hands and then he straightened right up. No, he said I'm not whipped I found Newport and I found the store and I can find another good town and another Ben Franklin just wait and see and So think about that. You're Sam Walton. You're 32 years old You have wife several kids and you just spent five and a half years Building up a store that was a phenomenal success and somebody took it from you from your own mistake He wasn't Sam wasn't out there blaming other people and I love his response there. He's like, I'm not you know I'm not whipped. I'm not gonna feel sorry for myself. That's fine. I made a mistake I won't make that mistake again, which we'll get to in a minute and I'll build up again from scratch And so this is when he finds Bentonville, Arkansas because he's driving around he's looking again running the same political Let me go to the small town. Let me try to buy a Ben Franklin franchise for somebody who wants to sell He finds one in Bentonville and he doesn't make the same mistake. So what he does is like, okay, I will buy This store from you. It's too small So I also need to get the barbershop next door Sam insists on buying the building and then next door He's like, well this store is too small. We're not gonna make any money I got a knock down this wall And so he finds that the barbershop next door is actually not for sale And so he's like I will lease that but I need a 99 year lease you won't sell to me. That's fine Then I need a lease that that lives longer than I do now the lease the barbershop is owned by two widows They say the first time he comes to them. They say no the second time He says they say no the third time they say no the fourth time. They say no the fifth time They say no the sixth time It took six tries and you'll see he does this exact same playbook when he's recruiting people in some cases He will recruit the same person and they'll tell him no for a decade This guy is relentless, but finally the sixth time they finally agree to this outrageous, you know 99 year lease and At the same time he suffers a devastating personal tragedy his mom dies Unexpectedly from cancer she was just 52 years old She went in for an operation to remove some of the cancer and then a few days after the operation she passed away So think about this He's 32 years old right he used all he's married with with kids like I said earlier He used all of his money setting up the new store in Bentonville. Okay, he's got no he's got no money So he's 32 wife kids no money your mom who you adore dies at 52 years old Unexpectedly at the same time. He still has to run his Newport store till the end of the year So he is commuting back and forth and even though the stores are only 250 miles apart It's like an 8 to 10 hour drive because it's through these mountains and the reason I bring that all up together is because you know No money your mom dies dies Your stretch as thin as could be and yet it is this driving back and forth that leads to one of the most important ideas That he ever finds because he starts to think what the heck If I can never if I cannot move ground faster, right? I will always be relegated just having one store you already know by now Sam Walton's not the personality type to be like Oh, I'm just gonna run one store for the rest of my life And so it's during these long drives to the mountain eight hours ten hours each way He's like I've got to figure out a way to cover faster ground and then he hears the buzz of an airplane overhead and The author does a great job of describing this I want to read this to you sometimes hardship can enlighten and inspire This was the case for Sam Walton as he put in hours and hours of driving Ozark Mountain roads in the winter of 1950 But that same boredom and frustration triggered ideas that eventually brought him billions of dollars He was struck with the realization that if he was competent enough to operate separate stores in two towns successfully Why not three four or maybe even a dozen? He could see the possibility of his own chain of five and dime stores one evening He heard the drone of a small airplane overhead and a light flash in his brain So he goes down to the local airport He's like maybe there's a faster way kind of like charter a plane and can somebody fly me between Bentonville and Newport It says says for a reasonable fee He chartered a pilot to take him to Bentonville the eight hour road trip strength to a 90 minute flight This gave Sam the answer he was looking for without this his Walmart phenomenon never would have been able to see the light of day and So it's no surprise that the Bentonville store starts to do really well because Sam's paying attention every single thing and he's just has This idea now, I guess I need to back up. He is all constantly until the IPO He is constantly under financed and under capitalized. He actually talks about that in his autobiography So I'm gonna read from his autobiography again before I pick this story back up He says many of our best opportunities were created out of necessity the things that we were forced to learn and do because we started Underfinite underfinanced and under capitalized in these remote small communities Contributed mightily to the way we've grown as a company had we been capitalized or had we been the offshoot of a large corporation? The way I wanted to be that's what I referenced earlier We tried to give away the idea to Walmart and they said no We might never tried all these small little towns that we went into in the early days It turned out that the first big lesson we learned was that there was much much more business out there in small-town America than anybody Including me had ever dreamed of so his idea at the very beginning This is the good thing you like it he had to prove the concept over, you know, many many years Then once he knew was working important, you know gasoline on these promising sparks But his idea first is like let's get one store up that source profitable Let's take the profits dump that into another store then get that store profitable then dump it into another store And so that is why the planes become so important. These are not corporate jets. He's like flying around There's a bunch of almost like very close calls, you know Sam Walton was a kind of reckless flier But you know think thankfully nothing happened in his 40 years of flying But without these like small little Cessna's in the little planes They could net he could have never gone and traveled to all these stores because that leads me to the next thing I want to talk to you about it's not just that you know What JC Penny was doing back in the day going to all of his? 1600 stores same thing Sam would do when he has this chain of five and dimes same thing Sam would do when he has his chain Of Walmart's he did it for every single one of his competitors. He visited more retail stores than anybody else in history He does is he actually he does it for the stores and in his autobiography says that he would also show up at the headquarter Like the the corporate headquarters without an appointment and he says if you just show up and you ask more often than not They would let you in and then he would ask him questions about pricing distribution and all this other stuff He's like it was another form of education. And so he's doing this in the 1950s he's going to like Oklahoma and Arkansas in all these little country towns and he says he studied how they did things He was ready to pounce on any successful little trick they had and would copy it And so when I got to this section of the book two things happened one I had like a big smile on face because I just think it's hilarious I love people that are truly dedicated to what they're doing and you know I would say one of my favorite maxims is actions express priority you demonstrate to other people what's important to you not by what you say Not by what you believe but what you do actions express priority And so you got Sam running around all over the south visiting every single store and so that just made me smile and laugh and I love people like that the second thing that came To mind is because I've become friends with mr. Beast mr. Beast is like the biggest creator on the internet biggest youtuber He's got like a billion followers across all these platforms I actually flew to mr. Beast headquarters and spent seven hours with him His top team one of my friends is a major investor in mr. Beast companies as well And I heard a story that just screams like this is something that Sam Walton would do and so mr. Beast comes back from doing He's like a 17 hour flight or something like that lands back into the United States needs to do another connecting flight to get back To like the remote area where his headquarters is and instead of jumping on another flight. He maps out there's like a 500 mile distance between where he's at and where his home is and mr. Beast chocolate company feastables has a Massive deal with Walmart and so he does instead of flying home He maps out every single Walmart in like a 500 mile radius and decides hey I'm gonna drive you can take a couple hour flight or you can do like a 15 hour drive I think this is over multiple days and he visited every single Walmart in between where he was and where he was going and so at every single store visit He would find room for improvement and one of the funniest things I heard was when in some cases In the front of the store it'd be it looked like all the feastables was sold out and then he'd pull up He's like well my system says that you have inventory So he would go to the back of the store and he would find The inventory in the back and he'd literally carry it to the front so he could get more sales I think that is what Sam Walton would do. I just love that idea where you have this this crazy Determined madman in the 1950s driving through all these little towns Inspecting every single retail store that he finds going to the headquarters dropping in on the CEO and a doctor and just Riddling them with questions and using as a form of education And then you see 70 years later and the same kind of determined individual doing something very similar. I just love that part So as Sam is expanding he's opening new stores. I already told you earlier. He literally lifts that idea from JC Penney He's like, okay I can't be here but he knew that you had to have a single like single threaded leadership There has to be one person that is completely responsible for the performance of the store when Sam is not there So that's when he says hey, I'll give you 25% of all the profits and then here's a fascinating story for you Dude, this is what I love about biographies We have some of the smartest most productive people that ever live and the bi feast their life stories Are full of them making mistake after mistake after mistake. And so as he's expanding he comes across this Brand new phenomenon at this point in American history There is no such thing as the shopping center and so as he's looking for locations to expand he comes across I think it's the second shopping center ever built in the United States and he's just like oh my god This is this concept is genius. And so he gets distracted He is already building a it's small but very successful Variety store five and dime chain and he takes a detour from something that's already working says I'm gonna develop shopping centers I have a line for this what he's doing because I did this other day I was on the phone with my friend Jared and is explaining about this other idea I had for another podcast and he was like completely shut it down and he used a blackjack analogy He's like don't split tense Sam Walton split tens. I'll cut right to the punchline We lost our money and left town. So he had like a one to two year detour where he took his eye off the thing That was working. He got distracted He gave in to distraction and it cost him the opportunity cost of his time and a bunch of his money So now he is back fully dedicated fully focused on expanding his burgeoning retail empire. I love scrappy people I love relentlessly resourceful people I love people who don't take no for an answer And so Sam is always on the lookout for new exciting merchandise that he can stock in his stores at this time hula hoops is like This is this like phenomenon spreading all across the country The main like manufacturers of hula hoops will not sell to these small little merchants because he's tiny at this time And so Sam's like, okay, cool. You won't sell to us. That's fine We're gonna make our own so he started he realized like what is a hula hoop? It's like this little peak it's colored plastic pipe with just a connector at the end He's like we're just gonna make our own so after the stores close him and a bunch of other people they get together and they Start making several thousand of these a night So that's the first part of this high agency relentless resourcefulness. This is hilarious to me Remember Sam does not have a lot of money He's underfinanced undercapitalized for a long time all the way until Walmart goes public and Walmart doesn't even exist yet And so they're making them at one central location, but they've a distribute them throughout all the stores that they have right? Sam didn't even have a truck. So how's he gonna do this? He has a car, you know, he does he sets up a John boat a Like 12 foot little John boat behind his car and loads the John boat with all the hula thousands of hula hoops that they spent the night making and then he drives it around to his stores and a car and using a John boat as a trailer and The end result is this line the hula hoops were so popular that you couldn't keep them in stock and So there's a combination of two ideas here They think are really important number one doing things that others were not doing lead to unexpected success And two goes back to that quote that I read from Sam's autobiography the fact that Many of the best opportunities were created out of necessity because we were so underfinanced. We were so undercapitalized We had no idea just how large these businesses can be built in what you know These towns these towns were ignored and so they arrived at this very valuable idea through trial and error They're just testing a bunch of things and so here's a description of one of the things they found out that the larger They made the store the more money they made the decisions were made for Walmart long before Walmart as a company was developed back in the Ben Franklin days We learned so much and so they use one example of a store where they make a Slightly bigger slightly larger Ben Franklin store and how much sales grew as a result of just having a larger store surprised them And so this store the example that they're using was in this little town called st Robert so st Robert showed us how much volume was there if we went into much larger units in small communities and push the merchandise We became the first independent variety chain in the country to try large stores in small towns We were doing an amazing amount of business in a 13,000 square foot store which is totally out of character for a town of just 2,000 people We found that we could do a million dollars in each variety store. That was unheard of and So it is through this constant experimentation the fact that he is still relentlessly Visiting every single retailer everywhere he's at that he discovers what is going to be his life's work, which is discounting The concept behind discounting at this time was very counterintuitive that you lower the price you lower the margin but you'll make more money because you sell more and All throughout his autobiography all throughout this book every single interview that you'll see with Sam Even though he didn't do a bunch of interviews He talks about the fact that you know I have no shame in admitting this like if I would I was searching for good ideas and if I found a good idea if I found a Competitor that had a better idea than I did I would just adopt he was always he didn't care of the origination source of the idea He just wanted the very best idea So he's like he says if they had something good we copied it and it is through this that he says I was totally fascinated by the idea of discounting and when he discovers discounting in the 1960s he's blown away. He winds up studying this guy named Erwin Chase who starts this company called and and hope they only had six stores, but they're doing $50 million a year in sales so all throughout the early 1960s It says there was no discount store in existence between 1960 and 1962 that did not get a visit from Sam Walton And it is through this that he discovers that another person had studied and and hope too And they'd studied it before him. There's this guy named Harry Blair Cunningham He is the one that comes up with the concept for Kmart And so Kmart was a dominant player way before Walmart and so Sam Walton is looking back on this he's saying what I'm about to read to you in 1990 after he's already beaten Kmart He says I've always had the greatest admiration for Harry Cunningham Because when he threw that business down that thing was 10 or 20 years ahead of its time and he did it better than anybody else What I did later was take pieces of it meaning take pieces of Kmart and make our Walmart as much like it as we could the difference was and this is fascinating thing that happens over and over again is Kmart took the discounting idea and they set it up set up shop in major cities Walmart looked at that. It's like well, why would we compete head-on with somebody? It's already doing that We'll take the discount idea and set up in tiny tiny little towns And so back to what Sam was saying at the start we were so amateurish and so so far behind Kmart just ignored us. They let us stay out there while we developed and learned our business if they had jumped on us I hate to think of that, but we were protected by our small town market It would have been unthinkable for them to have tried to put a competing store in a small town They gave us a 10 year period to grow and then he also brings up the fact that they got rich and Successful and fat and lazy. They were self satisfied with what they had accomplished Sam Walton was never to the day he died was never like that. They were self satisfied with what they had accomplished They thought they could roll over everybody and they woke up one day and found out that the world had changed And so now Sam knows he's like I cannot stay in the variety store business I can not stay in this fine and die business discounting is going to roll over everything Let's get ahead of this and this is where this is where he goes. So keep in mind I guess I should back up. He's 43 years old when he's making trying to make this transition He's got 13 of these variety stores, right? He's been Franklin franchisees our franchises over the last 11 years He's built 13 of these stores So he goes this is what I meant when he goes and tries to give away the idea for Walmart he's gonna go to the to the headquarters of Ben Franklin in Chicago and he's going to pitch this idea to them and This is the idea that turns out to be Walmart I'm gonna read this whole section to to you because it's so fascinating to me. His proposal was audacious Certainly unacceptable. He suggested that the variety store franchisers leap into the front line of the booming discount business I think that kind of store will fit in the rural markets just as well in the major metropolitan markets Sam said you should franchise them and I will be your guinea pig Imagine Sam Walton pitching you on the idea that of a brand new business That's growing like a weed and it's clearly the future and he's like I will be your partner and operator and you say no That's incredible the Ben Franklin executives exchanged sour looks Sam went on You're gonna have to cut your wholesale prices instead of making 20 to 25 percent profit off the merchandise that you sell to your retailers You're gonna have to be satisfied with about twelve and a half percent. So almost half They blew up they blew up at Sam to these Sophisticated and experienced businessmen in their tailored suits and customs shoes in Chicago Okay, it looked like the tail was trying to wag the dog What was this Arkansas Country Fellows experience with only a dozen or so stores? Compared to their thousand outlets and nearly a century of retailing know-how We have to pause here because this is such an important point You have to think about the incentives of the people that you're selling to Sam Walton is trying to sell to them So the greatest example that got lodged in my brain many years ago No one is ever eager to fix a cash machine that isn't broken and the person that put that idea into my brain the fact that You have to think about the incentives of the people that you're selling to then no one is ever eager to fix a cash machine That isn't broken is in James Dyson's autobiography. He invents the world's first Cyclonic vacuum cleaner that means his vacuum cleaner doesn't need bags So before that if you own a vacuum cleaner, you're constantly having to buy more vacuum bags, right? What is James Dyson do the first person he tries to go and sell his invention to is a company that is making? 500 million a year selling vacuum bags He's like, oh they're gonna see how superior a cleaning machine that my vacuum is compared to theirs that is irrelevant You cannot sell a bag this vacuum cleaner to people to make 500 million a year selling vacuum bags You cannot sell the idea of discounting at a lower margin and saying hey sell me your stuff at 12 and a half percent And selling instead of selling it to me at 25% How do you think they paid for those tailored suits and those custom shoes? with that 25% margin and So they laugh him out of the room and then there's a great story that is told in this book It's also told in Sam Walton's autobiography the very next day one of the Ben Franklin executives goes and checks out He's like, I maybe I should go check out this new Kmart thing that this crazy Sam Walton fella is talking about and here's a description Of what happens he got a surprise Sam Walton was there ahead of him here He was 25 miles from our office and he was talking to a clerk He was writing in a little notebook and at one point he got down on his knees to look under the display cabinet I said, mr. Walton, what are you doing? And he said it's just part of the education process Don. I'm still learning and So Sam talks about this time. It's not like he thought discounting was the future, right? But he wasn't sure if he could do like he was gonna succeed at it He knew he could he was really good the variety store business, but he decides I'm just gonna experiment He's constantly experimenting and he talks about this the way he describes this point of his life He has a great term on he says I was thrashing around for the right way to go. It was uncertain But one thing that he knew is that discounting does not work if you have a high cost structure Discounters must they must have low cost and there's like these all these indicators that Walmart might be more successful than their competitors Early on it was because even after they go public they have like the lowest Cost-to-sales ratio in the entire industry and so how dedicated was Sam to keeping costs low? Well, Walmart is called that in part because fewer letters means cheaper signs on the outside of a store And so Sam and one of his executives have this list of names. They're trying to figure out What what are we gonna call this new concept? You know, I have to go out on my own the Ben Franklin guys They don't want anything to do this. So I'm gonna do it anyways, which one of those do you think we should call it? They study the list for a few minutes and all were long names each made up of three or four words And so as executive says well Sam you had me buying the letters to go up on our Ben Franklin stores And I know how much they cost and how much they cost to repair and how much to light these letters it's expensive to put that many words in a name and the shortest name on the list was Walmart and So Jeff Bezos has the saying he says we know from our past experiences that big things start small the biggest oak starts from an acorn if you want to do anything new you've got to be willing to let that acorn grow into a little sapling and Then into a small tree and then maybe one day it'll be a big business on its own Listen to the description of the very first Walmart the business that is going to generate for the Walton family quarter of a trillion dollars of wealth the first Walmart is in a small town and is only 16,000 square feet it is an immediate success from the very first year. What do they consider a success? $700,000 in total sales which may seem like a small number But from that day from day one the store that furry first Walmart store for the next 15 years has a consistent 30% growth in sales it made a profit from the very beginning So then he opens the second one he invites this guy named David Glass who is gonna many years into the future is going To be become the CEO of Walmart Sam tried to recruit him really early in fact it takes him a decade to get David Glass to say yes So he invites David Glass out to the second opening of the opening of the second Walmart And this is what David Glass said David Glass thought that Sam might have lost his marbles with all this discount store foolishness It would surprise him if this kind of store had any future it was the worst retail store I had ever seen Sam had brought a couple of trucks of watermelons in and stacked them on the sidewalk He also had a donkey ride out in the parking lot It was a hundred and fifteen degrees and the watermelons began to pop and then the donkey began to poop all over the sidewalk and the Watermelon and the donkey shit ran together all over the parking lot and got inside the store Like so many people before him and since David Glass was guilty of a snap judgment on this unorthodox merchandiser named Sam Walton in fact is a great description of you know Sam's personality and part of His like success is this like promotion ability. There's this article in 1989 in Fortune magazine I'm gonna quote from and it says so how from there from this like crap, you know In this this exploding watermelon donkey crap opening so how from there did Sam Walton get to be America's most admired retailer He willed it through sheer force of a complex personality as the donkey watermelon episode illustrates He's an old-fashioned promoter in the PT Barnum style, but he's more than that. He's a little bit Jimmy Stewart. He's handsome He's got this all shucks charm. He's also a little bit Billy Graham. This is what I meant Billy Graham's his famous preacher Sam Walton's very much an evangelist. He's a little bit Billy Graham with a charisma and a parade persuasiveness that Heartland folks find hard to resist and he's more than a bit Henry Ford a business genius Who sees how all parts of the economic puzzle relate to his business? Overlaying everything is that of an old yard rooster who is tough loves a good fight and protects his territory And so the mistake that glass made is the mistake that most people make they don't understand that small Improvements every day over a long period of time What that compounding can generate the thing that I asked to underestimate about Sam is that he has an overriding? Something in him that causes him to improve every day. That's not difficult when you have something as bad as he had back in Harrison This is the donkey and the watermelon store, but sometimes you achieve success and say boy now I got it Like I want it I can lay back a little and enjoy it Sam never did that He has never gotten to the point where he is comfortable with who he is or how we're doing And this is probably my favorite description of Sam Walton in the book His tactics prompted people to describe him as a modern-day combination of Vince Lombardi who insisted on a solid Execution of the basics and General Patton who said a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week And so once he realizes Walmart is a winning formula he he starts to expand really rapidly But what do you see is at the very beginning? He's just got a simple basic plan simple basic principles that he executes on so the first thing is he's obsessed We've already mentioned it once just like there's principles for Amazon that could be distilled down to obsess over customers for Walmart It was just customer satisfaction He said the essential ingredient is of course customer satisfaction hardly a day passed when without Sam reminding an employee Remember Walmart's golden rule number one the customer is always right number two if the customer isn't right Refer to rule number one and so what he means by customer satisfaction is always exceeding the expectations of the customer So let's say you buy a pair of shoes. They don't fit. You don't like them Whatever the case is you bring them back Sam would tell his stores Not only should you cheerfully replace the shoes meaning you should be happy you should smiling Then you should throw in a pair of socks and stockings for the hassle He understood the value of a satisfied customer that that customer is gonna come back to Walmart not next week Not just next week not just next month it were her bit humans are habitual they'll probably be shopping there for decade after decade as long as you don't upset them or let them down and Then as far as expansion, you know, this is pre computers Which will get to just the massive surprising investment that Walmart made in computers in the 1970s But before that he's like, okay I want to run a bunch he had like this idea was like I need to make sure that all my stores are so close to The distribution center that my trucks can deliver whatever you're missing that same day He essentially started with the distribution center and then work backwards and he's like I don't want to expand outside of this distribution center if it takes my truck drivers longer than five or six hours to get to Any one store and so the first handful of Walmart's were in this 300 mile radius of Bentonville, Arkansas And that's really what it was his faith and this adherence to this small handful of principles that he refused to deviate from he's talks About this later I had no vision of the scope of what I would start but I always had confidence that as long as we did our work well, and we were good to our customers there would be no limit to us and For this fact alone is why reading these biographies in these early company stories are so important because it talks about like how There's a lot of rough edges in these Walmart stores the eighth Walmart ever and they put it in this old It used to be a coca-cola Bottle in plant and so it still wasn't all the way converted and so you had like all these pipes sticking up out of floor Everywhere there was no air conditioning in that entire building. So what's their solution? Okay, we don't have AC We can't put it in before we open we'll just get 28 window fans and then we'll take care of the AC problem later and There's a line that describes what this was like in the very early days of what's gonna become a very valuable company It says it was still largely a seat-of-the-pants Instinct of Sam Walton that guided this Walmart expansion again at the beginning there's gonna be a lot of rough edges and Half working things and not a lot of process the way I think about the early days of Walmart is the exact way I think about the early days of Disneyland with Walt Disney. There's a great line in that book. I just covered the history of Walt Disney if you haven't listened to it It's episode 177 how Walt Disney built his greatest creation which he considered his greatest creation to be Disneyland and one of the people working with Walt was Describing this time says you asked the question. What was our process like? I kind of laughed because process is an organized way of doing things I have to remind you during the Walt Disney period of designing Disneyland. We didn't have processes We just did the work process came later all of those things all these things had never been done before Walt just gathered up all these people who had never designed a theme park or never designed a Disneyland So we're on the same boat at one time and we just have to figure out what to do and how to do it on The fly as we go along and not even discuss plans timing or anything We just worked and Walt just walked around and made suggestions same exact idea is happening in the early days of Walmart and So now Sam realizes a Walmart is the main thing This is where my entire focus should be on and so this is where he really really wants to start putting He's really think about how long like he did five and a half years with one store store in Newport, right? Learning learning slowly proving that he knows what he's doing then he gets Ben Franklin another Ben Franklin story then, you know a handful I think in what 11 years he does 13 more stores watch how he's the weird thing I'm trying to describe to you is like he's simultaneously Impatient and has an abundance of patience if that makes any sense So it takes a while to make sure he knows what he's doing is actually gonna work But once he knows it's going to work He puts his foot all the way on the gas pedal and so up until this point he's got one big problem He is eyeballs deep in debt. It's like causing him anxiety stress He's been borrowing and financing the expansion of Walmart's he gets loans from banks and loans from Insurance companies and he's dying for a permanent solution and he only has one idea for a permanent solution He's like we have to IPO we have to we have to tap the public markets And so he's gonna meet these local Arkansas entrepreneurs. They're called the Steven brothers They're gonna team up with another Wall Street firm that is successful in selling the stock I'm gonna get there in one second because it's kind of nuts at how Spookily accurate a bunch of Sam Walton's predictions are but I just love they give a short background in the book on the Steven brothers Who you know are very helpful in getting this IPO done? I'm gonna skip over all that I just love the advice because they were like, you know poor Arkansas boys too And they wind up being they hit the Forbes 400 list too for different reasons But I love the advice that their dad told them when they were growing up in like rural Arkansas He says he used to tell sons don't be ashamed of your poverty and don't be proud of it Just get rid of it as quickly as you can and his sons made good on that advice But I want to talk about how nuts it is That Sam's he was just dead on on a lot of his sales growth So he's doing this pitch to potential investors and they're like, okay Your sales volume right now is around 20 million dollars a year and Sam's like, yes, sir Our business is really growing this year. We did 21 million 21.3 million That's quite a jump because the year before we only did 12.6 million and he says our calculation is that in the next five years our five-year projection from now that in 1975 our sales will be 230 million and so the the other side of the table is like decidedly skeptical like this guy's in nuts and Here's the punchline Sam Walton, however, was right on target total sales for 1975 came to 236 million dollars so in 1969 when he was done with that he was at 21.3 he's like we're gonna hit 230 million five years from now and he came in at 236 and Then I want to point out a part of Sam's personality. This is also something he shares in common with Jeff Bezos He's very polite. He has a country charm But he drives the way he pushes his top executives. He pushes them Unbelievably hard it's really fascinating the difference each the way he treats his like frontline workers who he spends a lot of time with Pays attention that makes him feel special make sure they're doing their good job But like he doesn't push them like he pushes his top executives And so it says Sam had seen others resign or get fired because of the rigors of working in a pressure cooker For a boss that some executives called that old slave driver That's that's this internal nickname. There's a line from one of Jeff Bezos is Biographies that's very similar It says if you're not good Jeff will chew you up and spit you out And if you are good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground So they both hold their top executives to an unbelievable rigorous rigorous standard of excellence The way I think about Sam's affable country boy personality with what's really inside When I read a biography on a young Bill Gates excellent book if you haven't read it yet It's called hard drive the making of the Microsoft Empire covers the first 35 years of Bill Gates life You realize that a young Bill Gates was just Genghis Khan and a mr. Rogers costume Something similar is going on here with Sam says he also claims that the public conception of Sam is a good old country boy Wearing a soft velvet glove misses the fact that there's an iron fist within that glove the boss himself candidly agrees I guess I can get a little tough if I see things I don't like Sam stressed that he knew his business from top to bottom I used to do it all sweep the floor keep the books buy the merchandise One of my assets is my willingness to try something new and to change That is a concept that we carry out throughout the company. We have a low resistance to change. We call it our RC factor And so there's many examples in the book of what I just referenced the fact that as hard as he is on his executives Hard as he seems to be on his executives He's just as supportive of his frontline workers and genuinely cares about them There's a bunch of examples Here's one he would flag down one of his own 18 wheelers and climb into the cab to ride a hundred miles with the driver To gain firsthand experience that might improve Walmart transportation He would get up at 2 30 in the morning buy a box of donuts and take him over to his warehouse to the warehouse loading Dock where he solicited ideas to upgrade their effort if the docker said they needed two additional shower stalls They immediately got them. This is all connected to something that Sam Walton would repeat remember repetition is persuasive So he repeats over and over again throughout this book But also in internal communications that he believed in management by walking around when Sam discusses his management style He's dead serious about identifying it as MBWA management by walking around. There's this company newsletter called Walmart world that would go out every month and it says this adherence this reference this Repetition of the importance of management by walking around at sit for Sam and for everybody in the company It rarely not appear in an in an issue. Think about how crazy it is every month He's just repeating the same thing the importance of this same thing over and over and over and over again These are all great ideas and smart things that Sam Walton does. Let's get back to another mistake. He winds up retiring He he recruits this guy named Ron Mayer who he thought of like this boy genius And so I will read to you my note which gives an overview of what's about to take place here stepping aside of the company you spent your whole life building because someone else is in a rush does not seem wise and So Sam was about to turn 57 and Ron Mayer is putting pressure on him saying hey, you know I don't want to just I want to run my whole company like I want to be CEO of Walmart and you know if I can't do that here then I'll have to do it somewhere else And so it says as he approaches 57th birthday Sam Walton was reluctantly trying to change his lifestyle completely by surrendering the day-to-day command of his Walmart Empire Now Sam was gonna find this impossible to do and I'll describe Essentially retired and never retired. It's the weirdest thing and so he's having this conversation with his wife and his top executives He says I'm gonna lose Ron if I don't step aside and I don't want to lose him He's a very talented guy and so his official Sam had retired Ron was a new chairman and CEO of Walmart It is the most uncharacteristic Sam Walton kind of thing that Sam Walton ever did so essentially he retires But he's still working his role was now supposed to be unofficial But he couldn't keep his hands off when he saw something anything he didn't think was right He just stepped in and corrected on the spot. That is the way I've always been I guess I was getting in the way of Ron's authority and the problem is the numbers the sales and profits under Ron Mayer They're he's doing a man a magnificent job, but Sam just has to control the company It bothered Sam's conscious that he had personally made a mistake He discovered that he really wasn't ready to retire that he missed his old job. And so he comes to this fork in the road He's like, okay, this obviously isn't working You either have to get back into it take back your job or you have to leave completely and so when he tells Ron Hey, I'm coming back over. I'd love to keep you. Of course Ron's gonna do what most people do is like, you know I can't accept that I'm not gonna stand for devotion. He winds up leaving the company So Sam takes back over control the company does exactly what he goes back to doing exactly what he's doing and that's say He's always recruiting now. He not only did he lose Ron Mayer He lost a bunch of like Ron Mayer's lieutenants. So he lost, you know big chunk of his executive staff So he's got to go back and recruit and he does what he does over and over again He would pitch the same person over and over and over again So someone said Sam Walton used up men the way he threw wood into his fireplace Just like the logs they blazed up with a fury Generated powerful and beautifully efficient flames and after a time died down into cold ashes It was necessary for him always to be looking for good men and talent to replenish his stockpile He fell back on old habits and started to recruit again those who had scornfully turned him down before One of these people was going to be David Glass the eventual CEO 10 12 Maybe 15 years into the future where we're in the story he's eventually going to become CEO and rather successful CEO of Walmart and David didn't go into this job, you know ignorant or blindly he knew he says he was under no Misconceptions he could expect to work harder and put in more hours than ever before in his life And now we get to one of the most mind-blowing things that happens in the book He's mind-blowing to me. Remember he was talking about the fact that he is not resistant to change now He has his principles He's not going to deviate from but he always wants the best ideas and he repeats over and over again You know, he says RC is that formula resistance to change like we want a low resistance to change. We're willing to change It's a trademark of like the Walmart culture the Walmart philosophy Every day is a different situation in the retail business. We have to be flexible These are things that that Sam Walton would repeat now this in this is insane what they do here the size of the investment So at first, you know, this is 1979 Okay at first his team his top executives people he trusts are like we need computers. We need help The business is like it's too unwieldy We don't we need actually we need more organized data be able to make better decisions And at first Sam thought computers were just overhead But then he listened and he learned and he changed his mind and more importantly and he invested he put his money where his mouth was Finally his lieutenants educated and convinced Sam and Walmart Walmart plucked down 500 million dollars for a modern Communications computer system and when they say computers this time history, there's like giant IBM mainframes And so now all the Walmart stores the warehouses and the distribution centers are able to communicate in real time By 1979 the stores and warehouses could communicate around the clock with headquarters. So keep in mind inside of every single store There's at least 36 departments in each store and they're all selling different things So this computer system is now telling them daily sales from not only every store But every single department inside of every store they tell them what the bank deposit for that day is they would estimate sales figures They would flag reports on like hot selling items that they mean may need to either order more and deliver more to the stores You'd have up-to-date warehouse inventory and it goes on and on and on so Sam is writing the annual report of Walmart 1979 and he summarizes perfectly he says the financial savings and the number of personnel hours saved daily by using the computer center are Incalculable even by the computer. So it's one thing to say yeah, we're willing to change. We want the best ideas Sam is 61 years old when he makes this decision 61 years old investing 500 million a half a billion dollars in 1979 dollars That's one of the most remarkable things in the entire book I think just proves his dedication is like I want he talked about investing in technology is a huge Advantage that he had over other discounters too But he's putting his money and his actions behind this where his mouth is when he when he said, you know He was saying with his mouth no, we have a low resistance to change We want the best ideas and then it's one thing to say that's a completely different thing to match up his actions in this half A billion dollar investment with that. That's nuts to me Another surprising thing that I don't think I remembered, you know, I've read this book before I've read Sam Walton's autobiography twice I've reread my highlights and notes from those books I don't even know dozens of times and I had forgot so once he realized all Walmart's the thing He he's like man this thing's growing too slowly and it's hilarious because this is what he considers slow growth And I'll tell you how he fixes this so from 1974 to 1977 He goes from 78 Walmart's to 153. So let's call that double and he goes from annual sales of 167 million to 478 million and he's like this is too slow So what he does next is something I had forgotten he actually accelerates store growth by acquiring Entire retail chains and then converting them to Walmart's Now that he's a public company now, he's got access for the first time in his ever he's got access, you know to weigh more resources He's not constrained by money anymore. And so he buys a chain of 16 Discount stores converts into Walmart. Then he buys another chain of a hundred and four stores converts into Walmart He's showing that he can master both growth internally and by acquisition So there's just a few more ideas that I want to tell you about two main ones But here's another interesting one that reference or the fact that Sam is constantly collecting information from the front lines Hates people sitting in the office like you need to get in stores and you need to go all across the country But as Walmart grows they have like this entire fleet of planes And so they they use their planes every single day to be on site where the work is actually happening But his friend's daughter has a bad experience at Walmart and She actually calls her dad who just happens to be with Sam at the time and it was fascinating And so we're hearing the story says my daughter bought a pair of shorts for her father-in-law they turned out not to be the right size so she goes back and They didn't have the right size But the manager is refusing to give the money back and so she calls her dad From the store her dad just happens to be with Sam Sam gets on the phone and he listens to the customer and her name is Sarah Bell and so he listens to Sarah Bell and he Goes, okay Let me talk to the manager Sam talks to the manager then the manager suddenly gets really really nice and gives the money back And so later on Sam's friend was apologizing. Oh, sorry, you know to disrupt you getting on the phone with my daughter And he goes no I'm glad that Sarah called that the way he learned on that phone call had been it's it's been worth its weight in gold I told the manager that I wanted him to bring that pair of shorts to our Saturday morning meeting I made him stand up and hold up those shorts Then I asked him what is our motto and he said satisfaction guaranteed, you know every once in a while You have to refresh their memory This constant flow of information from the front lines from the people actually serving the customers from the customers themselves Is something that Sam Walton definitely believed in here's another fascinating idea This one definitely surprised me and I think it's another example of Sam copying good ideas I mentioned earlier that his father-in-law played a huge role in his life You know having a successful businessman entrepreneur as a father-in-law to give advice to not only did he loan the first $25,000 for that first store But he saved them untold amount of money in the way that he had him set up the estate planning the Forbes 400 list Assume that Sam Walton owned all that Walmart stock turned out he had given it away Years before it had any value and he got that idea from his father-in-law When and how and why he and Helen shared their business resources with their four children is one of the more fascinating Untold Walton stories the children have each owned one fifth of their parents stock and property since 1954 Sam and Helen created the trust that set this up when Ron was 10 and Alice was only 5 Doing this kind of estate planning so early in the game was urged on by Sam Through his father-in-law L. S Robson who had earlier done precisely the same thing in giving Helen and her siblings Equal shares in the vast ranch that he assembled in Oklahoma. Mr Robson was a banker and a lawyer and he was pretty smart Sam said I could see it was the thing to do and this all Took place four decades ago And so his son is talking about this at that time all dad and mother had was a variety store or two Our shares then couldn't have been worth more than $5,000 each at the time the book was printed which is in 1990 each of the kids were worth about two billion dollars because of this So by turning over ownership of 80% of his holdings to his children so early on he avoided any substantial gift or inheritance Taxes and so his father-in-law put it best the best way to reduce paying estate taxes is to give your assets away before they appreciate Alright, so let's talk about speed and sole price This is one of my favorite stories entire book something that Sam Walton said over and over again That he took more ideas from soul price than any single other person think about how relentless guy was on studying Everything that everybody else was doing. He's like, this is the person I learned the most from in fact I had a cool experience happen. You might be interested in this. I read soul prices autobiography It's not my autobiography his biography was written after soul price passed away by his son Robert price That is episode 304 in that episode I talked about how soul price is the most influential retailer of all time Sam Walton learned from him Jeff Bezos Jim Sinegal the founder of Costco the founders of Home Depot The list goes on and on and on about how influential soul price was anyways I put that episode out Robert price souls prices son the author of that book listened to the episode and emailed me He loved the episode and he thought it honored his father and his father should be honored If you haven't listened to episode go back and listen to and try to find that book. It's incredible soul price is a remarkable man So let's talk about soul price and speed look how fast Sam Walton is moving. Okay, so he's got this idea He's got one more study successful. He's never we just heard somebody else say earlier He doesn't he's never gets fat and happy with his success That never has never happened didn't happen in the past and didn't happen up until the day he died And so he's always looking for you know, I believe in Walmart and discounters But there's always people coming with new ideas and he realizes that soul price is going to invent an entire new category And so it says on a January morning in 1983 Sam Walton flies to San Diego to investigate a new wrinkle in the discount business a Membership Wholesale Club what we think of as Costco and which obviously turns into Sam's Club as well The idea originated five years earlier by a savvy California entrepreneur named soul price Soul price was making an astounding success by selling merchandise than only a 10% above manufacturers prices and getting rich if soul Price could do that Sam Walton figured he could too the Wholesale Club idea was good extremely good and So Sam goes back to Bentonville. He's like, okay We're just gonna do the exact same thing that soul price is doing out on San Diego and we're gonna do it We're gonna call it Sam's Club and we're gonna start right now. This is insane first visit January 1983, okay January he does his first visit April the same year He opens the first Sam's Club in the next eight months before the end of 1983 Okay, so January 1st. He visits the first one doesn't have any by the end of that same calendar year He's got three then the next 12 months. He opens eight more within three years of stepping foot in Soul prices price club Sam now has 23 Sam's Club Wholesale Stores and he's doing 776 million dollars That's insane from nothing to almost a billion dollars in sales in three years And then within seven years he's got a hundred and five of these things and they're doing five billion a year extreme patience Coupled with extreme intolerance for slowness. That is the career of Sam Walton he's gonna take a sign to make sure this thing works and when it works he pours gasoline on it and So it's this extreme bias for action that runs throughout this entire book It's what Jeff Bezos says Jeff Bezos said that two of the things that he learned most From Sam Walton's autobiography that he applied to the early days of Amazon is Frugality and a bias of action and I think this extreme bias of action is a great place to close and will close in Sam's Own words our method of success as I see it is action with a capital a and a lot of hard work mixed in as We've said throughout the years do it try it fix it It's not a bad approach and it works There are a lot of people out there who have some great ideas but nothing in the world is cheaper than a good idea without any action behind it and That is where I'll leave it. If you have not yet read Sam Walton's autobiography I would read Sam Walton's autobiography first if you have a top 10 list of you know Entrepreneur biographies autobiographies that Sam Walton's autobiography is got to be in that list So if you haven't read that one yet, I would highly recommend doing that You can also listen to the episode I did on the last episode I did on Sam Walton's autobiographies episode 234 if you've already Listen to the podcast listen to it again and read the book then I would highly recommend getting this book as well Sam Walton is far too important of an entrepreneur to only read one book around about So if you buy this book using the link that's in the show notes or your podcast player also available at founders podcast calm You'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. That is 354 books down 1000 ago and I'll talk to you again soon Okay, so what you're about to hear is this question I was asked a few months ago I actually recorded this a few months ago They asked how did history's greatest entrepreneurs think about hiring all the answers people think I have a better memory than I Then actually do you know if people say you gave you have a great memory my wife would laugh at that I forget things all the time. It's not that I have a good memory It's I reread things over and over and over again Every single answer every single reference you're about to hear in this 20-minute mini episode Came from me searching all of my notes and highlights that option is now available to you If you like what you hear if you think it's valuable if you're already running a successful company And you want an easy way to reference the ideas of history's greatest entrepreneurs in a searchable database That you can go through at your convenience anytime you want then you go to founders notes calm and sign up I Want to start out first with why this is so important. There's actually this book that came out in like 1997 Called in the company Giants. I think it's episode 208 of founders it's to Stanford MBA students if I remember correctly and They're interviewing a bunch of technology company founders and in there Steve Jobs is one of them this is you know right I think even before he came back to Apple and They were talking about well, yeah, we know it's important to hire but in a typical startup a manager or founder may not always have time to spend recruiting other people and I first read this is Steve's answer to this, you know, I don't know two years ago and I never forgot it I think it's excellent. I think it sets up why This question is so important and you should really be spending existing the early days like basically all your time doing this In a typical startup manager may not always have the time to spend recruiting other people then Steve jumps in I disagree totally I think it's the most important job assume you're by yourself in a startup and you want a partner You take a lot of time finding a partner, right? He would be half of your company I'm gonna pause there this idea of looking at each new hire as a percentage of the company is genius Why should you take any less time finding a third or a fourth of your company or a fifth of your company? When you're in a startup the first ten people will determine whether the company succeeds or not Each is ten percent of the company So why wouldn't you take as much time as necessary to find all a players if? Three three of the ten were not so great Why would you start a company where 30% of your people are not so great a small company? Depends on great people much more than a big company does okay, so to answer this question the advantage that um that I Have making founders and that you have as a byproduct of listening to founders is not only that I've read, you know 300 something biographies of entrepreneurs now But I have all of my notes and highlights stored in my readwise app and that means I can search for any topic I can look at the past highlights of books or I could search for keywords So what I did is first of all like what I've started to do with these AMA Questions is I read them decide which ones I'm gonna do next and then think about it for a few days I don't put any they just literally that I know that's the next question Just let my brain work on it in the background for a few days, and then I'll go through And start searching all my notes and so that's what I did here and so there's a bunch of you know I don't have I may have like 10 or 15 different founders talking about hiring The first idea is the most obvious, but I think probably works best when you're already established So Steve Jobs is talking about hey, you know Great way to hire is just find great work and find the people that did that and then try to hire them When you're Steve Jobs That's a lot easier right than if you're just somebody doesn't have reputation Maybe you don't have resources, but your company's rather new or not as well known David Ogilvy I just did confessions of an advertising man a couple episodes ago. I think 306 or something like that 307 and He did the same thing, but he's David Ogilvy at that point so he would find he'd go through magazines find great advertising great copywriting and he'd write the personal letter and Then set up a phone call and he says he wouldn't he was so well known and you know He's one of the best in his field that he wouldn't even have to offer a job Just the conversation then the person would the you'd want to hire the person never mention it and the person would apply to him And so again, I think if you can do that then of course, it's straightforward Find for somebody does great work. Usually you can do this. I actually have a friend that I can't say who it is He's doing this right now actually I have a friend that's really good at doing this He's finding people that do great stuff on the internet and then just cold cold DMing them and then getting convincing them to work on things and That usually works especially with people like younger people earlier in their career There's a bunch of different ways to think about this in a bunch of different ways to prioritize so the first thing that that came to mind that I found surprising is you read any biography on Rockefeller and He had a couple ideas where he felt the optimization You know table stakes that you're intelligent and you're driven and you're hard-working, right? We don't even have like if you're listening to this you already know that but he prioritized hiring people with social skills and so this is what he said the ability to deal with people is as Purchasable a commodity as sugar or coffee and I pay for I pay more for that ability than any other under the Sun There's the two the second part to this though, and this is also works Well, if you have access to more resources Rockefeller would hire people as he found as he found talented people not as he needed them It's not like okay standard oil has six open spots. Let's go find six candidates, right? He'd come across what he considered a talented person. He didn't even matter if he didn't know what they were gonna do He's like, I'm just gonna stack his team. And if you really think about the his partners of standard oil he essentially built a company an executive team of founders of Because he was buying up all their company so it's very rare but There's a line from Titan. I want to read to you taking for granted the growth of his empire He hired talented people as found not as needed and then I found another idea in Hiring like the actual interview process. So there's this guy named Vannevar Bush. I did two episodes on him I think it's 270 and 271. He is the most important American ever in history in terms of connecting the scientific Field private enterprise and the government the most important person to keep alive for the American war effort was FDR The second one was Vannevar Bush Vannevar Bush is like the Forrest Gump of this historical period He is involved in everything from the Manhattan Project to discovering like a young Claude Shannon to building a mechanical computer Like this guy literally has done he just he pops up in these books over and over again If you were reading about American business history during World War two and post-war war two you are going to come across the name Vannevar Bush over and over again I read his fantastic autobiography called pieces of the action and I came across this weird highlight and so this is his brilliant and unusual job interview process and So he's talking about this organization. He's running called amrad at amrad I hired a young physicist from Texas named CG Smith The way I hired him is interesting an interview of that sort is always likely to be on on an artificial basis and somewhat embarrassing So I discussed with him a technical point on which I was then genuinely puzzled the next day He came in with a with a neat solution and I hired him at once Here's another idea. This is from Nolan Bushnell Nolan Bushnell's the founder of Atari founder of Chuck E. Cheese and Steve Jobs mentor he hired Steve Jobs when Steve Jobs was like 19 at Atari He would ask people their reading habits in interviews This is why one of the best ways his whole thing was he wanted to build all of his companies Laid on a foundation of creative people. So that's what he's looking for He's like I need creative people one of the best ways to find creative people is to ask a simple question What books do you like? I've never met a creative person in my life that didn't respond with enthusiasm to a question about reading habits Actually, which books people read is not as important as the simple fact that they read it all I've known many talented engineers who hated science fiction, but loved say books on birdwatching a Blatant but often accurate generalization people who are curious and passionate read people who are apathetic in a different don't I remember? Well, that's such a great line and I obviously agree with it. I remember one I'm gonna read it again a blatant but often accurate generalization People who are curious and passionate read people who are apathetic and indifferent don't I remember one particular woman who during an interview told me That she had read every book that I had read. So I started mentioning books I hadn't read and she had read those two I didn't know how someone in her late 20s found that time this much time to read so much But I was impressed. I was so impressed that I hired her right there and assigned her to international marketing, which was having problems This is why this is why I'm reading this whole section to you a job with a lot of moving parts Benefits from a brain that has a lot of moving parts It wouldn't be possible to have read that many books without such a brain. So do you see what I mean? Like We start with Steve Jobs saying this is the most important thing that your role is the leader of the company the founders do right and You are and it's so important to study and this is why I'm glad this question exists And why I'm glad that I've I took the time and I had like the foresight to like hey I should really organize my thoughts and notes because there's no way I would have remembered all this without me being able to search my readwise Right, but you have Rockefeller saying this is what's important to me. You have Bush saying this is how I hire now You have Nolan Bush now saying well, here's another weird thing that I learned Let me go through what Warren Buffett says about this. So this is about the quality one thing that is consistent Whether it's jobs, Buffett, Bezos Peter Thiel this just pops up over and over again They talk about the importance of trying to find people that that are better than you the the hiring bar constantly has to increase now Obviously the larger the company gets that's impossible Steve Jobs has this great quote where he's like, you know Pixar wrote a book about the company Jobs has this great quote where he's like, you know Pixar was the first time I see I saw an entire team Attire company of a players, but they had 400 players. They had 400 team members He's like at the time Apple had three thousand. It's like it's impossible to have three thousand a player So there is some number That your company may grow to where it's just you're just not you're not gonna have thousands of a players in my argument I don't even know if you get a 400 I guess you I mean I'll take Steve's word for it on there and Pixar definitely produced great products But it's probably a lot lower than that as well. So Warren Buffett would tell you to use David Ogilvy's hiring philosophy And so Warren said Charlie and I know that the right players will make almost any team manager look good again That is why it's the most important function of the founder Maybe we're directly next to the product Right above the product actually because those are people building your product We subscribe to the philosophy of Ogilvy and Mathers founding genius David Ogilvy This is what Ogilvy said if each of us hires people who are small smaller than we are We should become a company of dwarfs, but if each of us hires people who are bigger than we are we shall become a company of Giants David or Jeff Bezos rather used a variation of Ogilvy's idea to Jeff used to say in Amazon every time we hire someone he or she should raise the bar for the next hire So that the overall talent pool is always improving they talk about this idea on Amazon where the Future hires that we do should be so good that if you had applied for the job You already have an Amazon you wouldn't get in that's a very interesting idea Take your time with recruiting take your time with hiring. There's this great book on the history of PayPal it's written actually I've recently become friends with the author his name is Jimmy Sony And this is in his book the most fascinating thing that I found was that PayPal prioritized speed So from the time they're they're founded to the time they sell to eBay it's like four years Jimmy spent more time researching the book than He spent six years researching book I always tease him because like you took longer on a book than they took to start and sell their company It just speaks to like the quality he's trying to do but that as a byproduct of that like obviously they move fast But they prioritize speed over everything else except in one area recruiting Max Lutgen kept the bar for talent exceedingly high even if that came at the expense of speedy set staffing Max kept repeating A's higher A's B's higher C's so the first B You hire takes the whole company down. Let's read that again a player is higher a players B players higher C players So the first B player you hire takes the whole company down Additionally the team the company leaders mandated that all prospects is another idea for you All prospects must meet every single member of the team now. The next one is the most bizarre It makes sense if you study I did this report on Larry Ellison three-part series on Larry Ellison I should read those books again because the podcast is like 50 times bigger than Then when I publish those episodes and he's just Crazy, so he would hire based on the coffin the self-confidence level Of the candidate listen to this. I have tears in my eyes. I don't know why I'm laughing. Okay It's okay because this is a you read about Larry Ellison and he's one of these people it's like really easy to interface with because he just You just know exactly who he is. So what's important to him? That's why I think it's so funny Ellison insisted that his recruiters hire only the finest and cockiest new college graduates When they were recruiting from universities, they'd ask people are you the smartest person, you know, and if they said yes, they would hire them If they said no they would say who is and they would go hire that guy and said I don't know if you got the Smartest people that way but you definitely got the most arrogant Ellison's and this is why The personality of the founder is largely the culture of the company Apple is Steve Jobs. Apple's just Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives, right? I was just texting a founder friend of mine He listens to the podcast. I actually met him through the podcast and he's going through this like Process of self-discovery like he's already started a bunch of companies are really successful But he's like I think I'm more of this type of founder than the other type of founder and that's good that he's doing That because he's hopefully his next mission is like his life's mission, you know And you can't get your life's mission unless you do you figure out who you are. Ellison knew who he was Ellison's swaggering combative style became a part of the company's identity. This arrogant culture had a lot to do with Oracle's success Here's another odd idea for you Izzy Sharp the founder of Four Seasons actually could figure it out that in his business which was hotels, right? That hiring could hiring the right person could actually be a form of distribution for his hotel He gave me the idea because of what what do we know? What do you and I know in our bones? That history's greatest founders all read biographies They all read biographies of people that came before them and took ideas from them. Izzy Sharp is trying to build Four Seasons What do you think he did? He picked up a biography of Cesar Ritz the guy that Ritz Carlton is named after the great arguably the greatest hotelier of all time And when he realized that oh shit Ritz he says remembering that Cesar Ritz made his hotels world famous by hiring some of the foremost chefs We decided to do something similar So what is he talking about Cesar Ritz went out and partnered with August Askaffie what Cesar Ritz was to hotel to building hotels August Askaffie was to French cooking and so what happened is you partner with world famous chefs people come into your restaurant That's in the hotel because the world famous chef and now they know about your hotel that leads to more get that meet leads to more activity in your restaurant that you own but also leads to More brand recognition of your hotel and then by as a byproduct that more people staying at the hotel So hiring as a form of distribution. This is fascinating as a fascinating idea. Okay, here's a problem You can identify great people right? Maybe they even want to come work. Like you've identified them. You've sold them Hey, this is what this is our mission. This is what we're doing and yet Humans have complicated lives. They have spouses. They have kids they have a reason Maybe they can't move across the country to work for you, even though they want to so There's a problem-solving element that you see in these books on You have to solve like you've already identified the person you've recruited them. They can't go for some other reason Okay, well the great founders are not gonna take no for an answer. I read in In this book called liftoff, which is about the first six years of SpaceX. This is what Elon Musk did They had anticipated his friends issue having convinced must they needed to bring this brilliant young engineer from Turkey Onboard it became a matter of solving the problem. His wife had a job in San Francisco She would need one in Los Angeles, right? Because that's where SpaceX is at the time there these were solvable problems and Elon's better at solving problems than almost anyone else Must therefore came into his job interview prepared about halfway through must told the guy that he wants to hire So I heard you don't want to move to LA and one of the reasons is that your wife works for Google Well, I just talked to Larry and they're gonna transfer your wife down to LA So what are you gonna do now to solve this problem? Musk had called his friend Larry Page the co-founder of Google the engineer sat and stunned silence for a moment But then he replied given all that he would come to work at SpaceX. That's really smart. There is Another idea when you're promoting are you gonna promote from within or from without you know, that's dependent on you depending on what's going on I do think this is interesting though. There's a guy named Les Schwab who built this this really Valuable chain of Like tire companies in the Pacific Northwest. I actually found out about him cuz Charlie Munger is like hey, you should read this biography He said it in a he didn't say to me personally He said it to in like one of the Berkshire meetings that to study less Schwab had one of the most one of the smartest financial incentive structures or any company that that Charlie Munger had come across so this is what less Schwab did He did not want to hire from he didn't want to hire other people from other companies because they might come with bad habits He'd like to train his own executives. And so he says in our 34 years of business We have never hired a manager from the outside Every single one of our more than 250 managers and assistant managers started at the bottom changing tires They have all earned their management job by working up and then another thing if you're gonna hire the best of the best and a Players their a players don't like to be micromanage And so this came in Larry Miller's Autopography called driven he owns like he owned like 93 companies all throughout Utah car dealerships movie theaters all kinds of crazy stuff but he also owned the the NBA team Utah Jazz and What was fascinating is he's trying to recruit Jerry Sloan as the coach at the point and Jerry Sloan would only take the job On one condition and I really like it. I really like this idea If you hire me, let me run the team in business, right? That's what you're hiring me for one of the best things we had ever done was hire Jerry Sloan as coach at the time He said I'm only gonna ask you for one thing if I get fired Let me get fired for my own decisions if you hire me, let me run the team Business here's another idea from Thomas Edison that I think is fascinating Really? The way I think about a founder is like you're developing skills that you can't hire for You you're gonna hire for everything else But you shouldn't be hireable and Edison wasn't Edison expressing his views on the preeminent role of applied Scientists which that's what he considered himself coined the expression I can hire mathematicians But they can't hire me and so when I read that paragraph for the first time the note I left myself was develop skills that you can't hire for Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable As they lauder would give you advice that you need to hire people align with your thinking and values Hire the best people this is vital hire people who think as you do and treat them well in our business They are top priority So this idea is like that seems kind of weird like hire people who think like You there's obviously not one right way to build a business I think though your business should be an expression of your personality and who you are as a person at the core And so I think there is an art to the building of your business and the reason he used the word art I don't mean in like a hoity-toity, you know pretentious manner. That's not me at all. I don't even care about I don't art at all really I mean that you're making decisions not just based on economics like there are non economic important decisions based on how you're building your business like you could probably make more money doing a decision a But decision a goes against who you are as a person or you just don't like it or it's just not as elegant or beautiful And so therefore you don't do it So that's what I mean about you know Hire people who think is you do and what for whatever reason when I read as they lauder say that I was like Okay, that there's like this art to what she's doing one thing that's gonna be helpful in recruiting This comes from Peter Thiel. I think this is the book zero to one Understand that most companies don't even differentiate their pitches to potential recruits into hiring So therefore like they're just gonna buy as a byproduct of that You're gonna wind up with a lower overall talent base And so he says what's wrong with valuable stock smart people are pressing problems nothing But every company makes us these claims so they won't help you stand out general and Undifferentiated pitches to join your company don't say anything about why a recruit should join your company instead of money of instead of many others So that idea of like your pitch your actual he would tell you you're you shouldn't be building an undifferentiated commodity business But even above and beyond that like you're the the mission that you're trying to engage Everybody to join you in that pitch that sale sale You're trying to make to potential recruits should be differentiated should not if that person's applying to five other jobs There should not be like it's like they may not like your mission They may not like your pitch, but they shouldn't be able to compare it to anything else another quote from Nolan Bushnell Hire for passion and intensity. That's what he would do All right That's what he did when he found Steve Jobs if there was a single characteristic to separate Steve Jobs from the massive employees It was his passionate enthusiasm Steve had one full one speed full blast This was the primary reason we hired him and one thing all these founders have in common is that he know how important hiring is And when something's important you do it yourself. This is again Elon Musk on hiring He interviewed the first 3,000 employees at SpaceX That's how important it was one of Musk's most valuable skills was his ability to determine whether someone would fit his mold His people had to be brilliant. They had to be hard-working and there could be no nonsense There are a ton of phonies out there and not many who are the real deal must said of his approach to interviewing engineers I can usually tell within 15 minutes and I can sure I can for sure tell within a few days of working with them Musk made hiring a priority He personally met with every single person the company hired through the first 3,000 employees It required late nights and weekends, but he felt it was important to get the right people for his company And then the close on this we started with Steve Jobs telling us Why it was so important and why should be a large part of how you spend your time and now we'll close with what you do After what do you do after you hire the person? This is what he says It's not just recruiting after recruiting It's building an environment that makes people feel they are surrounded by equally talented people and their work is bigger than they are The feeling that their work will have a tremendous influence and as part of a strong clear vision So that is the end to that 20-minute mini episode I just re listened to the whole thing and it really does I think it's a perfect explanation and illustration of why I think founders notes is so valuable because some of those books I haven't read in five six years and just The ability to have a searchable database of all this these ideas like this collected knowledge Of some of history's greatest entrepreneurs to reference and then contextually apply to our own businesses It's nothing short of like it's magic. That's a really the way I think about it I think it's a massive superpower gives me a massive superpower. I couldn't make the podcast without it I also think if you have access to it or make your business better And so if you're already running a successful business I highly recommend that you invest in a subscription and you can do that by going to founders notes calm
