--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The computer and the internet are among the most important inventions of our era, but few people know who created them They were not conjured up in a garage by a solo inventor Suitable to be singled out on a magazine cover or put into a pantheon with Edison Bell or Morse Instead most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively There were a lot of fascinating people involved some ingenious and and a few even geniuses This is the story of those pioneers hackers inventors and entrepreneurs Who they were how their minds worked and what made them so creative? The collaboration that created the digital age was not just among peers, but also between generations Ideas were handed off from one cohort of innovators to the next I Was struck by how the truest creativity of the digital age came from those who were able to connect the arts and the sciences They believed that beauty mattered. I Always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics Steve Jobs told me when I embarked on his biography Then I read something that one of my heroes Edwin land of Polaroid Said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences and I decided That's what I wanted to do The people who were comfortable at this humanities technology intersection helped to create the human machine symbiosis That is the core of this story Like many aspects of the digital age this idea that innovation resides where arts and scientists connect is not new Leonardo da Vinci was the exemplar of the creativity that flourishes when the humanities and sciences interact When Einstein was stymied while working out general relativity He would pull out his violin and play Mozart until he could reconnect to what he called the harmony of the Spears When it comes to computers, there is one other historical figure not well known who embodied the combination of the arts and sciences Like her famous father. She understood the romance of poetry Unlike him. She also saw the romance of math and machinery And that is where our story begins That was an excerpt from the introduction of the book that I'm going to talk to you about today Which is the innovators how a group of hackers geniuses and geeks created the digital revolution and it was written by Walter Isaacson, so let me tell you before jump into the book. Let me tell you how I found this book So a few weeks ago I read the book invent and wander the collected writings of Jeff Bezos The vast majority of that book is just written directly by Jeff Bezos, right? And but the introduction is written by Walter Isaacson It's a fairly long introduction and he's comparing and contrasting Jeff Bezos with other historical figures. So Isaacson has done a bunch of biographies that I actually did Podcasts on so Ben his I did his podcast on his book by American Benjamin Franklin American life Steve Jobs he he wrote probably the most famous biography of Steve Jobs and I also did his podcast on his biography of Leonardo da Vinci So in that introduction and events and wonder he's comparing Jeff Bezos to all these other people and he also compares it to this person I don't recall and it was this person called named Ada Lovelace and He mentioned writing a book on her and I was like, how did I miss that? Cuz I went through you know, once I find a writer I usually if I enjoy his books, I usually try to read others and so I realized he's talking about this book So the first chapter of the book that I have in my hand is about Ada Lovelace So, let me read just in case you were you're unfamiliar with her like I was let me just read the first paragraph from her Wikipedia page so says she was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed Mechanical general-purpose computer. This is in the 1800s That computer was called the analytical engine She is believed to be the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and to have published the first algorithm Intended to be carried out by such a machine as a result she's often regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of computers and And recognized as one of the first to be a computer programmer. So when I read that I was like, okay I definitely have to read this book Okay, so before I jump back into the book, I guess it's gonna tell you something right up front Normally when I sit down to talk to you, I'm really excited to tell you about the things I learned from reading the book I don't feel that way right now I feel very nervous because this is a much larger story than the life story of one individual It's a biography of sorts of the digital revolution and then maybe what hundreds of people that influence that So today is not going to do there's not gonna be much of a narrative here There's the story is just too large and Isaac's books. I mean he's incapable of writing Small books anyways, I'm looking at the biography of Da Vinci right now And you It's all his books are gigantic, right? And he does it and every page is very there's a lot of information on there So I'm just telling you up front because I'm very hyper sensitive to ever wasting a minute of your time It's going to be completely random These are just the highlights that I thought were interesting to get the full story You definitely have to read the book because there's just so much information in there. So with that out of the way I'm gonna jump into Talking about Ada Lovelace first and then I'll go through some of the other characters that I found were interesting and parts of The book and this is a little bit about her early childhood her early life. This is Lady Byron. That's Ada's mother wanted to make sure that Ada did not turn out like her father and Part of her strategy was to have the girl rigorously study math as if it was an antidote to to poetic imagination So Lord Byron in case you don't know he was one of the most famous English poets that ever lived He was alive and in the end of the 1700s died early died at 36 years old so does Ada And he dies in in 1824 So he is a he's completely different than what his daughter winds up being. You know the term Luddite It's it's now used as like shorthand to describe somebody's like anti-technology. It actually comes from these English textile workers Who in a form of protest broke all these Machineries these textile machineries that were used to essentially replace workers So Lord Byron was a large supporter of that He was very anti-technology thought it would makes us less human his daughter is very different She has the the romantic and poetical sensibilities of her father. But then as we see with her mother She she also has a love of technology and mathematics and sees the how the two fields relate. Okay, so that's just some background Isaacson talks about Byron. He's actually really funny interesting figure But that's that's in the book if you want to learn more about that So says despite these efforts Ada developed some of her father's propensities She had an affair as a young teenager with one of her tutors So they were talking about there is you know Lord Byron was extremely famous in his day Very much a playboy a ladies man Constantly had affairs and you know, just kept a stable of lovers in addition She had mood swings that took her from feelings of grandiosity to despair and she suffered various Maladies both physical and psychological she winds up getting she becomes addicted to gambling and Painkillers, I think so she gives you an insight So she says she decided on her own at 18 to begin a new series of lessons This is a direct quote from her. I must cease to think of living for pleasure or self gratification She wrote to her new tutor I find that nothing but very close and intense application to subjects of a scientific nature now seem to keep my imagination from running wild Her interest in technology was stoked when their mother took her on a trip through the British industrial Midlands to see the new factories and machinery Ada was particularly impressed with an automated weaving loom They used punch cards to direct the creation of the desired fabric patterns and she drew a sketch of how it worked And in this next section, we see a little bit about our personality. She definitely a misfit Like her father did not want to defer to authority She declared that she could relate to her father's defiance of authority referring to his misused genius She wrote to her mother if he has transmitted to me any portion of that genius I would use it to bring out great truths and principles. I think he has bequeathed this task to me I have this feeling strongly and there's a pleasure attending to it and we also see that She had a very she was full of self-confidence She developed a somewhat outsized opinion of her own talents and began to describe herself as a genius in her letters to Babbage That's the person this becomes a mentor. He's a let's say a generation older. Maybe like an older brother Several years maybe a decade and a half older than her and he's the one that is Developing the analytical engine which is you could think of as like a very early version of what's gonna turn into a computer So says in her letter to Babbage she wrote do not reckon me conceited But I believe I have the power of going just as far as I like in such pursuits So there we see in her writing her very developed sense of confidence again Isaacson does a great job of putting this into historical context So this is extremely rare for women at the time and then you have to have this This self-confidence to buck the trend of the culture that you're living in and the times That that Ada was alive and I'm gonna tell you more about that in a second this one sentence I just want to include before I go back into her self-confidence the whole concept of imagination Especially as it was applied to technology intrigued her So we see the why like why she's so interested in this Ada believes she possessed special even supernatural abilities What she called an intuitive perception of hidden things such a direct quote from her Her exalted view of her talents led her to pursue aspirations That were I just ran over my own point here her exalted view of her talents led her to pursue aspirations that were unusual for an aristocratic woman and mother in the early Victorian age Here's another quote from her. I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities Exactly fitted to make me preeminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature. She explained So what winds up making Ada Lovelace Famous is she writes what she titles at the time notes other people including Alan Turing and other people that are building the digital revolution Refer to it as Lady Lovelace's notes. It's a small It's like a almost like a small book 20,000 words on what she feels is the potential for a machine like Babbage's analytical engine and a lot of what she's going to Predict winds up coming true with the invention of the personal computer So says in her notes Ada explored four concepts that would have historical resonance a century later when the computer was finally born Actually, not even the personal computer the computers that came before them when they were the size of rooms The first was that a general-purpose machine one that could not only perform a preset task But could be programmed and reprogrammed to do a limitless and changeable array of tasks in other words She envisioned the modern computer and what's really interesting about this is she's seeing things that the inventor Babbage couldn't even see so says this insight would become the core concept of the digital age any piece of content data or information Music text pictures numbers symbols sounds video could be expressed in digital form and manipulated by machines She's having this insight in the 1800s. That's what makes her so unique Even Babbage failed to see this fully he focused on numbers meaning straight-up calculations just math, right? But Ada realized that the digits on the cogs could represent things other than mathematical quantities Thus did she make the conceptual leap from machines that were mere calculators to ones that we now call computers But then she takes it even further which is she's talking about artificial intelligence Again in the 1800s as well There was one other significant concept that she introduced in her notes it raised what is still the most fascinating Metaphysical topic involving computers that of artificial intelligence can machines think? Ada believed not a century later this assertion would be dubbed lady Loveless's objection by the computer pioneer Alan Turing Now Isakson summarizes why he feels that she's worthy of her reputation and respect She deserves respect as a person who rising above the expectations of her background and gender and defying plagues of family demons Dedicated herself diligently to complex mathematical feats that most of us never would or could attempt Her impressive mathematical labors and imaginative insights came in the midst of bouts of illnesses That would cause her to become dependent on opioids that amplified her mood swings and now he tells us about her response to her notes being published and her her response to her Contribution to what would be a brand new field for a while She was able to bask in acclaim from her friends and to hope that she would be taken seriously in scientific and literary circles Publication made her finally feel like a quote completely professional person. She wrote to her lawyer I really have become as much tied to a profession as you are It was not to be Babbage got no more funding of this machine of his machines They were never built and he died in poverty as for lady Loveless She never published another scientific paper instead her life spiraled downward and she became addicted to gambling and opioids She had an affair with a gambling partner who then blackmailed her during the final year of her life She fought an extreme exceedingly painful battle with uterine cancer accompanied by constant hemorrhaging I thought she died of a drug or us when she died in 1852 at age 36 She was buried in accordance with one of her last requests in a country grave next to her poet father that she never knew Who had died at the same age? and Now Isaacson summarizes her impact for us here The reality is that a diss contribution was both profound and inspirational more than any other person of her era She was able to glimpse into the future in which machines would become partners of the human imagination her appreciation for a poetical science led her to celebrate a proposed calculating machine that was dismissed by the scientific establishment of her day and She perceived how the processing power of such a device could be used on any form of information Thus did Ada countess of Lovelace help sow the seeds for a digital age that would blossom a hundred years later Okay, so now this is where the part of the book where Isaacson starts to build the history of the digital revolution Through the people that contributed to it. So I just want to read this one section to you I've talked about him on a number of podcasts Definitely the one on Claude Shannon He's also a figure in tuxedo park and a couple other podcasts have done and I've been I'm embarrassed now because We all know I can't pronounce anything correctly, but I've been calling this guy Vannevar Bush in Isaacson says Writes what I thought what I was reading is Vannevar and he says rhymes with beaver. It's Vannevar Vannevar Bush So it says Vannevar Bush and I'm gonna most likely read his autobiography maybe another biography of him He's definitely gonna come in the future because he's such an important figure and he appears in Those are the two books that come off time at mine, but I'm pretty sure he's been in a bunch of others So this is Vannevar Bush Remember his name for he is a key character in this book was able to build the world's first analog Electrical mechanical computer he dubbed his machine a differential analyzer Okay, so we if you listen to the the the podcast I did on the mind at play the biography of the fantastic biography of Claude Shannon That is the machine that Bush Bush hires Shannon to run that machine And so that's how the those their two lives connected now. He also is gonna this is where we get just getting to some random stuff Because again, the storage is much too large to build into any kind of narrative here. This is a little bit about Alan Turing It's just amazing It is absolutely amazing how many historical figures are in this book and there's maybe like ten of them that I've done podcasts on So says this on Turing there was a lonely intensity to him He also had a trait so common among innovators that was charmingly described by his biographer And he says Alan was slow to learn that indistinct line that separated initiative from disobedience This is actual writing his mother wrote In her memoir she describes her son he could be abstracted and dreamy Absorbed in his own thoughts which on occasion made him seem unsociable Indeed he surmised that the seclusion of a medieval monastery would have suited him very well. He's very introverted Did not He was very comfortable in Paying attention to his thoughts as opposed to other people Although he did work hand-in-hand with a lot of people Claude Shannon being one of them Claude Shannon obviously is gonna pop up in this book extremely important Because he wrote what people consider the Magna Carta of the Information Age. There was another seminal theoretical breakthrough in 1937 This one was the work of an MIT graduate student named Claude Shannon who that year turned in the most influential master thesis of all time That is a hell of a statement a paper that scientific America later dubbed the Magna Carta of the Information Age And I'm not gonna cover too much about Shannon that I already covered in the other podcast But I thought this was interesting because it's really a thesis behind the whole book and I say thesis behind founders It's the fact that we're constantly building on the ideas of people that came before us It's just better to know about those ideas right not to be Ignorant of all that humans accomplished before we were born at Bell Bell lab Shannon saw up close the wonderful power of the phone system circuit somebody just sent me a Book recommendation on Bell Labs, I can't remember the name of the book, but it's a history of Bell Labs I might cover in the future So says wonderful power of the phone system circuits which use electrical switches to route calls and balance loads in his mind This is what I love taking an idea from one field and applying it to another in his mind He began concocting the workings of these circuits to another subject that he found fascinating the system of logic Formulated 90 years earlier by the British mathematician George Bull Bull Revolutionized logic by finding ways to express logical statements using symbols and equations he gave true propositions the value of one and false propositions a zero a set of basic logical operations such as and or Not either or and if then good he's talking about computation there Isn't he could then be performed using these propositions? Propositions just as if they were math equations Shannon figured out that electrical circuits could execute these logical operations using an arrangement of on-off switches He says that is before it is possible to perform complex mathematical operations By means of relay circuits he summed up at the end this became the basic concept underlining all digital computers Okay, so I'm skipping over large parts of the book. There's a bunch. I have a bunch of highlights I'm not gonna share on the podcast is because they're just it's like one or two sentences about a person I'm gonna focus instead on the people that I highlighted a lot of so gives you like many stories within a story I found this guy named John von Neumann to be very interesting and this is just one of these people that have a broad set of knowledge about different subjects he's a mathematician a physicist a computer scientist an engineer and Just thought his way that he would collect a bunch of ideas and then assimilate all those ideas together to create new unique Ideas was very fascinating So says at this point one of the most interesting characters in the history of computing reenters the tale John von Neumann the Hungarian-born Mathematician who is a mentor to Alan Turing in Princeton or at Princeton and to give you an idea of the formidable intellect of von Newman it says if they meant this is a quote from One of the developers of the hydrogen bomb Edward Teller who once said if a mentally superhuman race ever develops Its members will resemble John John von Newman Von Newman was an elegant Bon vivant who hosted sparkling parties with his wife once or twice a week at their huge house in Princeton Von Newman wore a three-piece suit at almost all times Including on on a donkey ride down the Grand Canyon He ate so heartily that his wife once said he could count anything except calories and he drove cars with an abandon That was reckless. So I just found his personality very interesting. He's very full of life Again, just exciting von Newman developed an interest in in ways to mathematically Mathematically model explosive shockwaves this led him to become in 1943 a member of the Manhattan Project Later on Newman embarked on a mission to understand the potential of high-speed computers So he starts interacting with all these other people working in the same field. He actually gets one of his main criticism is that um He talked to this is a quote from another person the book says he talked about concepts without worrying where they came from He would go around talking to people Had a very extensive network constantly connecting with people together and if he learned something from you he'd repeat it Even and sometimes, you know, he'd forget where he learned these things from I don't really see a issue with that I think all ideas, you know No one really owns ideas They're just they're constantly built and manipulated through time and added upon by other people But again people they rubbed that part of Newman's personality rub people the wrong way I didn't see and based on Isaacson's writing any like malice or you know, I don't think he was doing it He wasn't saying hey, I'm credited with this. He was just very interested in sharing everything he knew Von Newman had also mastered the integrating art of Feigning humility. He was an amazing competent combination of a brilliant man who knows that he's brilliant But at the same time he's very modest and shy about presenting his ideas to other people He was very restless and would march back and forth across the room yet when he presented his ideas was almost as though he was apologizing for disagreeing with you or thinking of a better idea and Almost everybody that met him was like this guy's a flat-out genius And so we hear a little bit about that here It says it was a it was a manifestation of his broader talent Which was to get the essence of a new idea the thing that von Newman had which I've noticed that other geniuses have is The ability to pick out in a very particular problem the one crucial thing that was important Okay, I want to skip ahead to to so as much as I admired Newman on the other end of the spectrum. I Along with many people disliked William Shockley So you might know the name if you've listened all these podcasts by now I think way back on founders number eight, maybe I did the book the Intel Trinity It's about the founding story of Intel. I focused on Bob noise So I found really interesting as a mentor Steve Jobs But he worked for William Shockley before he started his own company He wasn't leaving Shockley's company because Shockley was so inept at managing and just a disfavorable person in general So this section is really not about Qualities that we want to emulate but ones we want to avoid right which I think is the other Part the benefit of learning from history William Shockley impressed the others and sometimes frightened them with both his intellect and his intensity definitely definitely smart really crappy people skills Though even as a baby He had a ferocious temper with fits of rage so loud and so long that his parents kept losing babysitters and apartments His tenacity was ferocious in any situation. He simply had to have his way He was incisive creative and ambitious He never learned to be easygoing or friendly He had an intellectual and personal intensity that made him difficult to deal with The pride he should have felt in the success of his team was overshadowed by his intense and dark competitive drive He wanted all the credit. That's this is what I mean about he was not a good person to run a company And he later's admit this being like a defect in his personality says my emotions were somewhat conflicted He later admitted my elation with the group success was tempered by not being one of the inventors I experienced some frustration that my personal effort. This is the he winds up inventing an improvement on somebody else's invention That's what he's credited for but that's what he's referencing here. He's got so mad that he made him work harder So he could actually get the credit Okay, so says I experienced some frustration that my personal efforts started more than eight years before had not resulted in a significant inventive contribution of my own There were demons that increasingly gnawed away deep in his psyche He would never again be friends with Bardeen and Brattain these are two people who was working with Instead he started working feverishly to claim equal credit for the invention and to create on his own an even better version And this is where we see more of this what I've described petty behavior from him Shockley became increasingly Disconcerted so much so that he had trouble sleeping his will to think as he called it was driven by my own Motivation to play a more significant Personal rather than managerial role in was in what was obviously becoming a development of enormous potential importance So he's talking about this is all ego here, right? I'm just doing this not for the betterment of any bales But because I want adulation from other people at odd hours of the night He would pace around searching for better ways to make the device And this is just more on the faults of Shockley here one problem with successful teams Particularly intense ones is that they sometimes break up it takes a special kind of leader Inspiring yet also nurturing competitive yet collaborative to hold such teams together Shockley was not such a leader. He was just the opposite. He was autocratic often snuffing out spirit by quashing initiative His prickly personality meant that he was passed over for promotions the hell with that. He told a colleague I'll set up my own business. I'll make a million dollars that way and I'll do it out in, California And this move to California is what many people believe is the very beginning of Silicon Valley He traveled the country trying to figure out his new venture. This is actually smart He visited technology companies and met with successful entrepreneurs such as William Hewlett and Edwin Land He winds up getting funding He's gonna shockly semiconductor is gonna be like a subsidiary of another company and the person that he wants to get funded from Is this getting backman and the no I left myself on this page was just facepalm Because shockly didn't you again? He's extremely arrogant but the problem is like part of the problem of being arrogant is you you think you know everything and He didn't know what he didn't know. So he starts assembling this board of directors And what does he do? He puts on all his competitors about it on it and this one more six experience actually like that's really stupid shockly like these your board is gonna be privy to Information that could help their business in a term harm your business. What are you doing? So he says I asked him a little bit more about who else was going to be on the board and it turned out he was Gonna have a board composed of almost everyone who was in the instrument business all of whom would be his competitors Beckman realized how unbelievably naive shockly was This was interesting shockly also insisted That the company be located in Palo Alto where he had been raised so that he could be near his aging mother Which then had the historical significance of helping to create Silicon Valley So he starts this company this is actually a smart move that he does I love Bob Noyce So he says he set up he set about compiling a list of the best semiconductor semiconductor engineers in the country and calling them cold the most notable of them all destined to be The most notable of them all destined to be momentous choice was Robert Noyce a Charismatic Iowa golden boy with a doctor from MIT who was at the time a 28 year old research manager in January 1956 Noyce picked up the phone and heard the words shockly here. He knew immediately who it was It was like picking up the phone and talking to God noise declared And so Noyce talks about why he had a obviously great respect for Shockley didn't work closely with him Didn't realize how deficient his personality was he winds up leaving shockly semiconductor taking a bunch of seven other people with them They're called the traders eight it's a very famous event in the early days of Technology industry but what Noyce is saying here was very interesting talking about why he spent so much like why he was so excited To work in this field He says I suppose that was one of the things that influenced me to get involved in transistors Noyce described his excitement more vividly The concept hit me like an atom bomb. It was simply astonishing just the whole concept It was one of those ideas that just jolts you out of the rut and gets you thinking in a different way Honestly, this is exactly how I feel about podcasts And now we get to the point where Shockley and rebels some leaders are able to will be willful and demanding while still inspiring loyalty They celebrate the audaciousness Audaciousness in a way that makes them charismatic Steve Jobs For example his personal manifesto dressed in the guise of a TV ad began Here's to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs in the square holes Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos has the same ability to inspire The knack is to get people to follow you even to places that they may not think they can go By motivating them to share your sense of mission. So that's what jobs and Bezos are able to do Shockley could not do that Many transformative innovators have been similarly stubborn about pushing a new idea But Shockley crossed the line from being visionary to being hallucinatory I don't that's how you pronounce that word turning him into a case study in bad leadership I do not want to get to After I die, I don't want people to write about me in this way. Like this is a this is a cautionary tale We're learning here turning him into a case study in bad leadership. That's terrible He couldn't face up to the fact that he made a bad decision So he started blaming everyone around him his paranoia already diffusing into his personality layers was manifest in disruptive incidents For example when a secretary at the firm cut her finger opening a door Shockley became convinced. It was a sabotage scheme. I don't even understand what he's talking about here He ordered everyone in the firm to take a lie detector test. It's got nuts When Shockley returned from Stockholm collecting his Nobel Prize the atmosphere at the firm deteriorated very rapidly He got way too high on his own supply. It began to resemble a big site psychiatric Institute noise told Noise told Shockley of the general feeling of resentment that was accumulating but his warning had little effect So this is where noise and he's actually has to be convinced later by Gordon Moore and other people to jump And this is where they're gonna do Fairchild semiconductor But this was a surprising way that the traitorous eight wind up getting funding and this is you're gonna see a character that's appeared in several other books I want to find see if there's a bag of found him because he was an early investor in Apple His name's Arthur Rock. I didn't know I forgot or maybe I maybe I never knew he's an he's gonna wind up being an early investor in Intel He was an early investor and on the board of Teledyne Henry Singleton's company Like how is this even possible? So says we believe that we could get a company into the semiconductor business within three months So they're there the traders eight trying to raise money There's really no venture capital industry to speak of at the time. And so they're sending letters to To Institutions investors just trying to figure out how to do this and it says the letter ended up on the desk of Arthur Rock Who's at the time was a 30 year old analyst who had been succeeding with risky investments? Rock was impressed as soon as I saw noise I was struck by his charisma and I could tell he was the natural leader They deferred to him at that meeting the group including noise made a pact that they would all leave together to form a new firm It was hard to get money the idea of seed funding for startups was not yet well established when someone suggested so our Arthur rocks trying to To be the one to do this deal and he said he's not having success So he winds up someone tells him hey go meet with this guy named Sherman Fairchild Maybe I should find a book on this guy too. Cuz he's he's an landish character Fairchild was the owner of Fairchild camera and instrument He was an inventor a playboy entrepreneur and the largest single stockholder in IBM, which his father had co-founded a Great tinkerer as a Harvard freshman. He invented the first synchronized camera and flash He went on to develop aerial photography radar cameras specialized airplanes methods to illuminate tennis courts high-speed tape recorders color engraving machines and a wind resistance match in the process He had a second fortune to his inheritance and he was as joyful In spending it as he had been making it He he put up 1.5 million dollars to start the new company and he has an option that if it's successful He can buy the whole company for 3 million which he winds up doing and then that part leads to the founding of Intel later Shockley semiconductor never recovered six years later Shockley gave up and joined the faculty at Stanford the traitorous eight who had forms fair Fairchild semiconductor by contrast Turned out to be the right people at the right time at the right place The demand for transistors was growing the civilian space program along with the military program to build ballistic missiles Propelled the demand for both computers and transistors. So I just included that part because you and I've talked about this over and over again There's just some something you see this this example in history over and over again There's the right person at the right place with the right set of skills at the right time Okay, so I want to talk more about Arthur Rock. He's the one that noise is gonna go to him When he leaves Fairchild semiconductor, well, let me not run on my point Let me just read this this is really about the beginning of venture capital. And again, I think this Arthur Rock characters are very interesting I'm not gonna talk too much more about noise. I have a new another biography of his coming Hasn't arrived yet, but so there probably be a new founders episode of him and I would say in the next few weeks Alright, so it says in 11 years to see assembled a deal for the traders eight to form Fairchild semiconductor Arthur Rock had helped to build something that was destined to be almost as important to the digital age as the microchip venture capital for much of the 20th century venture capital and private equity investing in new companies have been mainly the purview of a few wealthy families such as the Vanderbilts Rockefellers Whitney's Phipps's and Warburg's and it talks about one of the first you can consider like venture capital firms actually came from the Whitney Family fortune it says they set up a company called J. H. Whitney and company and listen This was really interesting which specialized and what they originally called adventure capital and their purpose was to fund entrepreneurs with interesting ideas Who could not get bank loans adventure capital sounds way better than venture capital. They should have kept that name, right? Adventure capital I'm an adventure capitalist. That's that's fantastic Arthur Rock took this concept West. Oh, so this is interesting So Arthur Rock is learning about what the Whitney's are doing and this is gonna remind you of the idea remember we talked about Milton Hershey You know at the time he had failed I think had two or three char field businesses goes out West I think to Colorado if I remember correctly and Realizes hey, they have an idea out here. I think was making like caramel Good tasting caramel that didn't spoil if I remember correctly and he's like I'm gonna take this idea That's out in the middle nowhere and Transport it back east and that's where he built his first successful company sells that company and starts Hershey chocolate, right? Arthur Rock does something very similar. He's like, oh the windies have a good idea Why don't I take that idea what they're doing and take it out West to California? Arthur Rock took this concept West ushering in the Silicon Age of venture capital when he put together noises short Traderous eight Rock took a stake in the deal after that He realized that he could raise a fund of money and do similar deals without relying on one corporate patron The money and then this is what he says about that. The money was on the East Coast But the exciting companies were in California. So I decided to move West knowing that it connects it to I like that idea because it could be by again, there's a Lesser known idea that's in a different place that maybe you could bring whether it's from one geography or one industry Whatever the case is I like the transfer of that and building value bringing something new to an area Whether it be an industry or an actual location that wasn't there before one of his key investment maxims was to bet Primarily on the people rather than the idea. We're gonna see how he does that with noise. I Believe so strong. This is Arthur Rock speaking I believe so strongly in people that I was that I think talking to the individual is much more important than finding out Too much about what they want to do That part reminded me of this famous quote that's in the book creativity ink by Ed Catmull the co-founder of Pixar He talks about you know gives these talks like what's more important people ideas and he's like it's obvious like ideas come from people So people are more important and the best illustration of that was this quote where he's like Listen, if you give a good idea to a mediocre team to screw it up But if you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team They will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better So I think that's what Arthur Rock is echoing there reason listen I'm about people because that person is gonna figure it out. I'm betting on the person It doesn't matter if their idea changes or not So says two of his first bets were on teledyne and scientific data systems with both paid off handsomely So he's talking about the early days of venture capital If I want so now noise comes up to him and says hey if I wanted to start a company noise asked Could you find me the money rock assured him it would be easy What could what could better fit his theory that you place your money on the jockeys? That you invest based on your assessment of the people running the company then an enterprise that would be led by Robert Noyne And Gordon Moore this is Intel obviously he barely asked what they were gonna make It was the only investment that I ever made that I was a hundred percent sure would succeed he later said So then they go into the early days of Intel not gonna cover that I do want to talk to you about Andy Grove real quick This is a couple few paragraphs that I thought were very very interesting This is about his early childhood, which is just insane. I should read this book actually It's it's highly recommended by a lot of people It's highly recommended by a lot of people so says as Grove wrote in his memoir swimming across by the time I was 20. I had lived through a Hungarian fascist dictatorship German military occupation the Nazis final solution the siege of Budapest by the Soviet Red Army a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war a variety of repressive communist regimes and a popular uprising that was put down at gunpoint I just can't imagine the kind of person like you survive all that what kind of person are you going to be is very interesting And I always talk about this idea of you know It maybe puts the the stress of building a company in the proper context again It's difficult, but it's not like that which had to live through So just a few more quotes about Andy Grove Grove had a blunt no bullshit style It was the same approach Steve Jobs or their use brutal honesty clear focus and a demanding drive for excellence So technically Grove wasn't a founder co-founder of Intel But Arthur Rock talks about this and Gordon Moore and Bob noise both acknowledge, too Like he was the person that should have been running the company They both both noise and more serve temporarily as the head of the company and they're like now we need to get this guy Grove's mantra was success breeds complacency complacency complacency breeds failure and only the paranoid survive So we have another extreme character there there's an entire chapter on video games Which I love and but really it's a chapter on Nolan Bush now And I we already you already know about him because I read his book finding the next Steve Jobs He's the founder of Atari and Chuck E Cheese also hired a 19 year old Steve Jobs I'm just gonna share one paragraph from this because he talks about you know There was no funding for a video game industry when he was building Atari like you kidding me And he talks about he had a runaway hit with the video game pong But he says I'm proud of the way we were able to engineer pong But I'm even more proud of the way I figured out and financially engineered the business he said Engineering the game was easy Growing the company without money was hard So now we get to the part about the very beginning like what what's laid the foundation for the internet I'm gonna talk more about Van Eever got his name right yeah Van Eever Bush real quick just as a brief overview Just as a brief overview before I jump into a book on him I found him to be a very interesting character bush was well suited to this task because he was star in all three camps He was the Dean of the MIT MIT School of Engineering a founder of the electronics company Raytheon and America's top military science administrator during World War two No American had had a greater influence in the growth of science and technology than Van Eever Bush again That's a hell of a statement This is more about crisp decisions and an overview of his life and work like many successful technology leaders He was an expert in both engineering products and making crisp decisions All of my recent ancestors were sea captains and they have a way of running things without any doubt He once said that left me with some inclination to run a show Once I was in it Lean sharp salty Van Bush is a Yankee whose love of science began in a passion for tinkering with gadgets While setting at Tufts he and his roommates consulted with a series of small companies and then after graduating founded Raytheon Which grew into a sprawling defense contractor an electronics firm here in a PhD in engine is He's one of these guys we've come across a few times where you read everything that accomplished. You just don't believe it's possible. I Felt this way reading about Theodore Roosevelt last week, too So he says he earned a PhD in electrical engineering jointly from MIT and Harvard Then he became a professor and a dean of engineering at MIT where he built his differential analyzer His passion was elevating the role of science and engineering in society at a time the mid 1930s When not much exciting seemed to be happening in either field the advent of World War two would change that Producing an explosion of new technologies with Van Eever Bush leading the way He oversell the Manhattan project to build the atom bomb as well as projects to develop radar and air defense systems Time magazine dubbed him general of physics He was a man of strong opinions which he expressed and applied with vigor If he stood in all of the mysteries of nature had a warm tolerance for human frailty and was open-minded to change when the war ended World War two that is Bush produced a report at at Roosevelt's behest He had to give the report to Harry Truman because Roosevelt wants dying that Advocated government funding of basic research in partnership with universities and industry Bush chose an evocative and quintessentially American title science the endless frontier So a lot of people that read that report later on and became inspired in their own careers It's also referenced in the book later the war Bush wrote had made it a clear beyond all doubt that basic science Discovering the fundamentals of nuclear physics laser computer science radar is Absolutely essential to national security. It is also crucial for America's economic security New products and new processes do not appear full-grown They are founded on new principles and new conceptions which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms of science a Nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress And weak in its competitive position in world trade So he's talking about the country level I say on a personal level that you can't you got to build your own personal curriculum I love that there let me go back to a nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in Its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade The creation of a triangular relationship among government industry and academia Was in its own way one of the significant innovations that helped produce the technological revolution of the late 20th century The return on that investment was huge Leading not only to the internet but to many pillars of the American post war innovation and economic boom. Okay, so that's Bush We'll get some more. I promise I would do a podcast in the future on him for sure Okay, so I'm skipping way ahead. There's this guy named Douglas Engelbart I've heard the name. I've read his last name a few times. I just found a book on him because It's just unbelievable Let me just read I just I'm just gonna spend one paragraph on him. So you understand He created almost Let me just read it in addition to the mouse and there's a picture in the book of the first mouse and it was created by this guy named Engelbert This is in addition to the mouse it included many other advances that led to the personal computer revolution So these are all his ideas. So let me back up Engelbert's working on these ideas in the 1960s. So he's working on it for several years and he's doing presentations on all this stuff So it says over the next six years coming in 1968 Engelbert went on to devise a full-fledged augmentation system augmentation system for computers trying To make them have more functionality that he called online systems in addition to the mouse and included many other advances that led to The personal computer revolution on-screen graphics multiple windows on a screen digital publishing blog like journals Listen to this is insane because this is the world we live in. I mean, this is in 1968 blog like journals wiki like collaborations document sharing email instant messaging hyper text linking Skype like video conferencing and the formatting of documents One of his techno charge protege's Alan Kay who would later advance each of these ideas at Xerox Park said of Engelbert I don't know what Silicon Valley will do when it runs out of Doug's ideas Okay moving forward we get to the part on software Bill Gates is at like half the chapter on software a lot of what I'm only gonna read a few sentences from this section because I Went back and looked at the notes that Isaacson use a lot of them come from that book hard drive Which I did a few weeks ago, maybe a few months ago But now so if you haven't gone back to listen to that make sure you do it's it's really interesting because it's The history of Microsoft and Bill Gates up until the time the IPOs and just you know How crazy was this is like many innovators gates was rebellious just for the hell of it He decided that he would this is this was hilarious. He decided that he's in at Harvard at the time He decided he would not go to lectures for any course in which he was enrolled and instead would audit lectures only on courses that He was not taking he's just being again rebellious for the hell of it And this is him talking about his personality time gates was the prime example of the innovators personality an innovator is probably a fanatic Somebody who loves what they do works day and night and may ignore normal things to some degree and therefore be viewed as a bit Imbalanced he said certainly in my teens and 20s. I fit that model Gate was also a rebel with little respect for authority. He did not believe in being deferential Then he started talking about Steve Jobs in his time at Atari. I thought this was very interesting Jobs showed up dressed in his hippie garb and said he wouldn't leave the lobby until he was hired Bushnell decided to take a chance on him And this is just a great line thus the torch was passed from the most creative entrepreneur of video games To the man who would become the most creative entrepreneur of personal computers now again I'm not gonna cover about six podcasts on jobs here But I do think this is I am actually gonna repeat myself because I think it's important This is just a few brief lessons of what Steve Jobs learned at Atari Jaws would later say he learned some important lessons that Atari the most profound being the need to keep interfaces friendly and intuitive Instructions should be insanely simple They give an example of an Atari game insert quarters avoid Klingons Forwards you know exactly what to do right devices should not need manuals That simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person Bush now Bush now was able to help mold Johns into an entrepreneur jobs into an entrepreneur There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that in Steve Bush now said he was interested Not just in engineering, but also the business aspects. I taught it. This is really important I taught him that if you act like you can do something then it will work I told him pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are And there's just a quote from jobs in here that I think is a really it's an interesting way to think about a new Market which is what he was doing when he invented His the first Apple computer right my vision was to create the first fully packaged computer We were no longer aiming for the handful of hobbyists who like to assemble their own computers who knew how to buy Transformers and keyboards and this is the interesting part the interesting way to think about a new market for every one of them There were a thousand people who would want the machine to be ready to run and there's something I don't recall on the other books. I read on jobs. He starts talking about The the Apple one as an information appliance Now that's a computer like just like you you have a fridge or anything else you plug it in and just it's very obvious I use a fridge or an oven or anything else and I like that idea Like I'm gonna do the same thing for appliances for information. That's very very fascinating Going back and forth now. There's a lot again You got to read the book because this is insane But I want to use that idea where Bushnell just told him act like you know what you're doing and people will believe you This is gates goes and has the most important meeting was life right when they meet with IBM And this is he comes back and I thought this is interesting Let me read the paragraph to you and then I'll tell you my interpretation of it once gates began his presentation However, they quit focusing on his disheveled appearance He wowed the IBM team with his mastery of details both technical and legal and projected calm confidence when insisting on terms It was largely an act When he arrived back in Seattle gates went into his office laid on the floor and agonized Allowed about all his doubts. So one act like your control and people will believe it Don't from Nolan Bush now, right now too. This is the big this is why reading these stories are so important because you know My everybody's image of Bill Gates now is completely different than that person right that young Bill Gates created the old version The biggest deal of his life and he's full of self-doubt What's the lesson there? You like it's not that you're gonna be immune to self-doubt. It's that you move forward anyways And just a few more sections of Steve Jobs. This is really about Steve Jobs competition personality stealing ideas the importance of Competition Let me just read it Steve Jobs and his team at Apple bought a new IBM PC as soon as it came out They wanted to check out what the competition looked like the consensus was to use John jobs phrase. It sucked Jobs was aroused by competition, especially when he thought it sucked He saw himself as an enlightened Zen warrior fighting the forces of ugliness and evil. That's funny One reason jobs was the myth dismissive was that he had already seen the future and was embarked on inventing it There's a just like there's a history of Bell Labs. There's also a book I think it's called dealers of lightning or something like that on the history of Xerox park. I'm actually gonna read There's a two-part series. I'm gonna do on Xerox the founders of Xerox soon And then maybe I'll do maybe make a three-part series and do the Xerox park so might be interesting But it says on visits to Xerox parks He was shown many of the ideas that Alan Kay Doug Engelbart the guy just told you about and their colleagues had developed Jobs two main visits with his team on Xerox park. We're in December 1979 This is where he's gonna steal a bunch of ideas. They use this Apple Jeff Raskin an Apple engineer who who was designing a friendly computer that would eventually become the Macintosh had already seen what Xerox was doing And wanted to convince jobs to look into it One problem was that jobs found Raskin insufferable the technical terminology he used for Raskin was a shithead who sucks Yeah, I love the way the young Steve Jobs man the way he communicated but eventually jobs made the pilgrimage He had worked out a deal with Xerox that allowed the Apple folks to study the technology and return for allowing Xerox to make a million dollar Investment in Apple he was great at making products, but jobs was really good at making deals, too Jobs was certainly not the first outsider to see what Xerox park had had wrought Its researchers had given hundreds of demonstrations to visitors But here's the important part so hundreds of people saw the exact same thing Steve Jobs did they didn't have they didn't do what he did next Oh, that's the difference but jobs was the first to become obsessed with the idea of incorporating parks interface ideas into a simple inexpensive personal computer Once again the greatest innovation would not come from the people who created the breakthroughs for the but from the people who applied them Usefully. Yes, that's the whole point You're sitting on a gold mine he shouted I cannot believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this When challenged when he was challenged about pilfering Xerox ideas jobs quarter Picasso good artists copy greater steals We've always been shameless about stealing great ideas. He also crowed that Xerox had fumbled its ideas They were copier heads who had no clue about what a computer could do They just grabbed defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry. He said in In fact neither explanation does jobs or Apple justice What really matters is execution jobs and his team took Xerox ideas improve them implemented them and marketed them Just a few more random things this is on Steve Case and the founding of American online a well I should find a book on him because I found this very interesting ask you that's the first time I saw the internet I was I don't know 12 years old maybe on IBM PC and using American online to get online Case came up with American online which caused many of his colleagues to gag So they're creating a service and helps people get onto the internet for the first time. This is really early What maybe 90s early 90s? I can't remember when it was founded But he says but case liked it He knew just as jobs just as Steve Jobs had when he named his company Apple that it was important to be as he later said Simple un-intimidating and even a bit sappy with no marketing dollars case needed a name that clearly described what the service did and the name American online accomplished that Case applied the two lessons he had learned while working at Procter and Gamble This is why I'm reading you the section make a product simple and launch it with free samples America was carpet bombed with software discs offering two months of free service That's how you got online back and that you connected to your phone and the way we got online they mailed your house It's a you put in the CD-ROM and you download it and you give you a free month a few a few months You put in the CD-ROM and you download it and you give you a free month a few a few They give you a few months free got you hooked and then you start paying for the service It now seems really really silly but up until 1992. Oh, this is another thing. That was interesting It's just one highlight, but they had to get a law changed This is hilarious. It now seems really silly But up until 1992 it was illegal to connect a commercial service like AOL to the internet And I got to include this this quote in here it's they talk about the beginning of the mosaic browser created by Mark Andreessen And this is Mark Andreessen on pioneers and Andreessen was a fan of the pioneers of the internet and their writings inspired him When I got a copy of Vannevar Bush's as we may think I said to myself. Yep. There it is He figured it out Bush envisioned the internet as fully as you could given that you didn't have that They didn't have digital computers. He and Charles Babbage are in the same league That's the end of Andreessen's quote another here was Doug Engelbart. That's the guy I keep mentioning He it's quote from is a quote from Andreessen about Engelbart His lab was node four on the internet, which was like having the fourth telephone in the world He had the amazing foresight to understand what the inner internet would be before it got built And finally, we're gonna close on back on Ada and this is about lady. Love. This is objection And really what this is saying is Ada's intuition was right Ada Lovelace would have been pleased to the extent we are permitted to surmise the thoughts of someone who's been dead for more than 150 years We can imagine her writing a proud letter boasting about her intuition that calculating devices would someday become general purpose computers Beautiful machines that can not only be that can only manipulate numbers But can make music and process words and combine together general symbols in a way that is not just a simple The analytical engine has no pretensions whatsoever to originate anything Ada Lovelace declared really what she's saying. She's saying that man and machine complement each other. They're not replacements for one another Peter Thiel in his book zero to one has an entire chapter about this in her mind machines would not replace humans But instead become their partners What humans would bring to this relationship? She said was originality and creativity Innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty to engineering Humanity to technology and poetry to processors In other words, it will come from the spiritual heirs of Ada Lovelace Creators who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder That opens them to the beauty of both And that is where I'll leave it for the full story get the book If you want to if you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes You'll be supporting the podcast at the same time. I read this book over I think five days I do not recommend doing that. I would spend more time on it Maybe spend a few days really digesting which each chapter says Isaacson does an amazing job of building. He links all these ideas together all these people together It's just a fantastic book. It's just a very it's just as a ton of information So what I would recommend if you do care to read it is just take your time with it So that is a hundred and fifty seven books down one thousand ago and I'll talk to you again soon
