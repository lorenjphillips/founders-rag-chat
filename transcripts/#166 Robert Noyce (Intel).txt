Bob Noyce took me under his wing Steve Jobs said I was young in my 20s and he was in his early 50s He tried to give me the lay of the land to give me a perspective that I could only partially understand You can't really understand what is going on now unless you understand what came before job said before Intel and Google before Microsoft and Apple and Pixar and stock option millionaires and Billionaire venture capitalists there was a group of eight young men six of them with PhDs None of them over 32 who disliked their boss and decided to start their own transistor company. It was 1957 leading the group of eight was an Iowa born physicist named Robert Noyce a Minister son and former champion diver with a doctorate from MIT and a mind so quick that his friends called him rapid Robert Over the next decade Noyce managed that company called Fairchild Semiconductor by teaching himself business skills as he went along in 1968 Noyce and his Fairchild co-founder Gordon Moore launched their own new venture a tiny company. They called Intel Noyce believed that big was bad or if not downright bad at least not as much fun as small companies in which everyone works Much harder and cooperates more When he left daily management at Intel in 1975, he turned his attention to the next generation of high-tech entrepreneurs That's how he met jobs and that's how he came to serve on the boards of a half a dozen startup companies and Informally provide seed money to many more He strongly believed he was doing his part as he put it to restock the stream I fish from He always threw himself entirely into the activity at hand in whatever he did. He tried to excel His powers of persuasion were legendary He inspired in nearly everyone whom he encountered a sense that the future had no limits and that together They could as he liked to say go off and do something wonderful He was like the Pied Piper if Bob wanted you to do something you did it His was not a simple personality. He was a small-town boy suspicious of large bureaucracies Yet he built two companies that between them employed tens of thousands of people he was a preacher son who rejected organized religion an outstanding athlete who chain-smoked and an intensely competitive man who was greatly concerned that people like him His favorite ski jacket featured a patch that declared no guts No glory and it was a fitting motto for a man who flew his own airplanes and Chartered helicopters to drop him off on mountaintops so he could ski down through the trees He was worth tens of millions and owned several planes and houses But nonetheless somehow maintained a just folks sort of charm Warren Buffett who served on a college board with noise for several years said Everybody liked Bob. He was an extraordinary smart guy who didn't need to let you know. He was that smart He could be your neighbor, but he had lots of machinery in his head His mother described him best when she said that he liked to do a lot of things and do them well That was an excerpt from the book thing We talked to you about today, which is the man behind the microchip Robert noise in the invention of Silicon Valley And it was written by Leslie Berlin Okay, so all the way back on founders number eight. I read the book the Intel Trinity and focused mainly on Bob noise and I discovered Bob noise by Reading a biography of Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs talks about at length how important and how important Bob noise was as a mentor and how Much he learned from him. So that's how I found that book now I think it's another great time to dedicate an entire podcast of Bob noise because last week and I consider this part two from last week's podcast, okay and William Shockley and Bob noise both worked in the same industry Bob noise used to work for William Shockley Let's say they even have the same level of intelligence and similar skills Yet why was William Shockley at the end of his life such a failure that his wife couldn't even have a funeral for him because No one would go and yet Bob noise had thousands of people at his funeral wind up achieving all the dreams of Starting companies and directing technology and building wealth that William Shockley had but failed to achieve so I think of William Shockley as a perfect example of what not to do and Bob noise is a perfect example of what to do And so the good way to think about Bob noise is he's the anti Shockley and that that term will come up several times today I want to go right into the beginning of his early life, though I was reading over the highlights that I had just now and I was surprised not surprised But I think the part of this book that I found most interesting was actually his time at Fairchild Semiconductor he's in his early 30s and it's because we see him struggle with Self-doubt and how he overcame that and not let that get in the way of actually building What wants it being one of the fastest growing companies in the history of American business? Which is Fairchild semiconductor and then not only be able to do that but to do it twice and do it again When he's in his 40s and do it with Intel that I found very interesting So first before I get there, let me tell you a little bit about his personality and his early childhood So he was competitive from day one. He's very charismatic very soft-spoken. You heard Warren Buffett say, you know He's very he didn't even you knew he was intelligent by talking to him, but he did not show it to you He wasn't aggressive in any means But he did not mean that he did not have an internal desire a very strong desire within him To be the best at whatever he was doing So says Bob noises early childhood memory involves beating his father at ping-pong and feeling absolutely devastated When his mother's reaction to this was hey wasn't that nice that daddy let you win Even at age 5 noise was offended by the notion of intentionally losing at anything That's not the game He said if you're going to play you play to win and one of I think the early motivating factors for Robert noise Why not only was he driven as a young boy? But his he grew up during the depression and the depression was having a devastating Effect to his family's finances his father is a minister Bob at this point It's just a little kid and his father's name is Ralph It says Ralph salary was once $2,400 a year and it now plummeted in 1934 he was paid only $1,200 a year. So he's already done 50% It gets worse the next year by mid 1935. The church was five months in arrears So now he's not even getting paid often He would he was given a wagonload of corn cobs or ham in lieu of pay And this causes his dad to have to find other means of employment he was they had four boys He was there constantly when the kids were little but because he needed to find a new job now He's got to travel all over the country and in his father's absence. He starts to have this early rebellious like misfit streak So say so it says in a single year Ralph had to drive more than 25,000 miles of twisting rural roads and addressed 110 different audiences His boys felt lucky if he made it home for Sunday dinner once every six weeks His mother called these years mothering with a daddy on the road And this is where we start to see that he starts he gets into this early misfit behavior Harriet this mom had her hands full we called a neighbor these boys, especially Bob were into devilment. What a great word by the way Bob started smoking cigarettes and he isn't he and his friends enjoyed tipping over outhouses on nearby farms So this rebellious streak that he says that he's exhibiting when he's younger young boy He brings with him to college and one of he talks about one of the most important lessons that he learned was in college he winds up stealing him in a group of His fellow classmates in college they wind up stealing as a prank stealing a pig from a farmer and he's going to this college called Grinnell to the tiny tiny little town and Bob had the bad luck that the person he stood the farmer that he stole the pig from Wines up being the mayor of the town and wants to press charges and he becomes very close to being expelled from college And at that time if you got expelled from one college other colleges wouldn't accept you So he talks about how being so close to his entire life because he what he was passionate about was studying physics To being derailed by one stupid mistake, which is the lesson he took away. It's like one bad decision can ruin your life We're not there yet This is how a friend of his in high school described Bob when he was in high school It seemed like he was always in a hurry to get somewhere and he got there He starts taking college level level physics courses and this is an insight into you know, the brilliant mind that everybody Said was very apparent when he got older Signed that this was there even when he was a young person and he meets probably the most important teacher That he ever has and he wants to maintaining a relationship with this teacher For his entire life and his teachers always constantly not only is he proud of Bob's achievements later on but he's always checking up on him in fact when Bob goes to MIT this teacher his last name is Gail was worried because he himself didn't have a PhD. He's like maybe I you know, I was his teacher Maybe I wasn't qualified. What if I sent him off to you know, go from a tiny little town To now, you know the quote-unquote big leagues in MIT. Like what if he's not ready? So it just gives you an insight He winds up writing to the college and like please tell me like give me updates on Noyce's progress This is somebody that cared deeply about teaching cared deeply about the people and I think I can't overstate that effect That could that the effect that knowing somebody that cares that much about you as a young person has And Noyce never he never forget forgets that he always tries to repay that So anyways, we're not there yet in his introductory course Gail focused on demonstrating the relevance of physics to daily life This is just a smart way to teach he eschewed note-taking He said that's what textbooks are for in favor of real-life demonstrations and he did not make the demonstration theoretical He tried to focus on practical knowledge So he says well what with what force did the snowballs he hurled against the side of a science building hit on the bricks? Why did a skater spin faster when she pulled her arms to her side a nice skater? Why could you fill a drinking straw with water? Seal the top of your finger and lift the straw without spilling the water How could you prove your answers to these questions? His stock of aphorisms was legendary and this is advice. He's giving a young Bob Noyce have the courage of your convictions He would urge hesitating a student hesitating to guess an answer be brave When a student with real promise began to ramble Gail would gently admonish if you can't divine it in one sentence You probably don't understand it And around this time his older brothers he felt he lived in their shadow They were extremely smart extremely accomplished and so he's he's hearing he's getting letters and he's hearing about everything they're accomplishing and The lower left myself is man You're gonna do so much more than this just wait and really the lesson to this this short paragraph is we really can't predict How far we're gonna go what we will experience if as long as we don't give up So says he listened attentively to his brother's stories about his trip to New York City remember This is a small town farm boy, right? He listened attentively to his brother's stories about his trip to New York City with the mixture of envy and insecurity That was his typical response to any of his brother's accomplishments. He wrote to his parents So he meaning his brother had seen this has seen the Statue of Liberty Wow Someday I may get to as well. I hope I'd better not stop dreaming So even in that paragraph, we're seeing that that little glimmer of insecurities what the the author described it as Keep in mind that that was temporary He did have a lot of confidence in himself and I really feel this next paragraph is just a great mindset to adapt So this is noise was slowly gathering experiences that would anchor his adult approach to life Which is not so much an approach as a headlong rush into any challenge with the unshakable Assumption that he would emerge not only successful but triumphant It was a risk for him to jump from his job in Philadelphia to go work to move across the country to go work with Shockley when he realized Shockley's crazy and a terrible manager It was a risk for him to try to jump to Fairchild Semiconductor, which he was one of the founders of then after realizing Hey, this is going too much I'm not enjoying the managerial part of this job I want to go back to the beginning of working in the lab and actually building the technology It was a risk for him to jump to Intel and so we see this over and over again that you know There's many times in his life that he said, okay, maybe he said, oh wait, that's you know, that's too much bigger risk I'm just gonna stay here. I'm going to settle and if you do that you snuff out your own potential So you've got to have this mindset. It's like, you know what? I may not not have the skills yet, but guess what? I learned I know how to learn I can learn these mindsets I actually I can learn the skills I need to do whatever is to tackle any problem that's in front of me and Bob has through the game through experience He's got a lot of ideas that he's gonna tell us about like not only a management But just risk-taking just the way he thinks he's got a beautiful beautiful mind as much as I hate Shockley and Shockley May have been the most distasteful person I've ever out of all the you know, 160 something biographies I've read for the podcast Shockley is probably the one I Disliked them the most on the other end of the spectrum like I really do admire No, he's not perfect. He's gonna make a lot of mistakes with his family Which he talks about and he advises younger entrepreneurs not to but he's extremely likable and intelligent person And I think my life's better is by reading his biography and by learning of his existence. All right, we're not there yet This is his father's description of Bob, which is a perfect way to describe him Bob thrived on adrenaline and gasoline Now why is in college he packs his days and he does this for the rest of his life He packs his days full of interesting things he's not the kind of person that's just gonna sit around and loaf around and something he did in in addition to his rigorous physics course load is he got interested in diving and so he wound up being a competing in diving and This is where What he's doing here to for before diving competitions is I think a good idea To to apply to whatever goal that you happen to have right in front of you and that's envisioning yourself at the next level And it says every night before he fell asleep No, he should mentally rehearse each of his dives in slow motion until he could see himself executing them perfectly He called this habit Envisioning myself at the next level and he carried it with him throughout his life in his mind's eye He could always see himself achieving something more now when I read that there's a lot of Ideas that are expressed by different people through different times in history that maybe not even knew each other, right? But they have different ways of saying similar ideas and when I read what he's talking what Bob Noyce is calling Envisioning myself at the next level it made me think of this quote by Mark and recent who is full of quotes if you go Back to founders number 50. I read the P marka his blog archive, which you can actually if you google and I think if you go back in the show notes of Founders 50 I included the link because you can do anybody can download this for free. I think it's like 200 and some pages I highly recommend reading it and obviously listening to the podcast I did on it because marks a really brilliant guy But he's also got great quotes and aphorisms that he just got a great way to communicate that stick with you forever I you know, I haven't read in what two years something like that and I always think about it So when Bob is talking about envisioning yourself at the next level, this is I feel a similar idea And it's mark and recent idea about how malleable the that the world around us is that we may not even know that so he Says the world is a very malleable place If you know what you want and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and Easily then you would think Bob is doing the same thing. He's just doing in his mind He's like I'm going after this energy drive passion and this is what I want. The end goal is I want the world to reconfigure Around me so I'm executing these dives perfectly also applies this to invents integrated circuit the founding of his two companies the Any kind of skill he wants to learn how to be a pilot He wants to learn how to fly jets and it's this whole thing is just like putting all your focus and energy into What do I want my life to be? You're not a bystander. You're the main character act like it No, he's just fascinated by the transistor. This is where he comes to idolize Shockly before he meets him because shock me, of course invented the transistor. Well, that's debatable But he was at least on the team that invented the transistor. Okay, so he's a Bob's young he's 21 years old when you first hear about the transistor But he immediately grabs him and it says it is impressive that noise that 21 was able to understand the Bell Labs report describing These events they're talking about obviously we know from last week that the transistor was Invented within Bell Labs. I says the report had been written by PhD scientists for senior electronic researchers Not for undergraduates. Yeah. Yeah Gail going back to his to his the most important teachers life Yeah, Gail insists that when it came to transistors, it would be a gross overstatement Suggests that I taught Bob much we learned about them together that that makes me think of Bill Gates when we read the book the hard drive, I think was founders number 140 and He Bill was like what is eighth grade ninth grade something that when he discovers computers at Lakeside and his teacher said something It's hilarious. He's like I knew more about computers than Bill Gates on the first day But not after that because he just said bill just stayed in there and observed all the information he possibly could so it was funny You see the echo here which in Gail and noise the information that noise absorbed about the transistor in his last months at Grinnell Inspired him noise graduated a double major in math and physics. He also received an honor from his classmates This was hilarious the Brown Derby Prize Which recognized the senior man who earned the best grades with the least amount of work? That's not the funny part The funny part is how he describes that to his parents or as noise preferred to explain to his parents The recipient was the man who got the best returns on his time spent studying Okay. So at this point Bob goes off and he's at MIT. He's doing his graduate work studying physics and he goes and visits his brother again and he starts he Leaves that meeting and he's depressed and he's insecure He doesn't he doubts his the path of his life the direction of his life And the reason I include this is because one I think most people would be surprised It's in almost every single book that we that we study here So that tells you like everybody goes through this a lot of people go through this They they get scared of that feeling and they quit or they stop or they go to comfort But that's not the right move. You got to push through it. Just like okay, this is normal Everybody's gonna feel this it's temporary. I may feel like this for a few days. Maybe a few weeks, whatever it is But I'm gonna keep going forward. I always think about what using Bill Gates another example, you know He's very cocky when he's younger. It's like I'm I'll be a millionaire by 30 winds up Under he was worth like 350 million by the time he's 30. So he's rather wrong about that He says I'll be a millionaire by 30 I just don't know how but then he also talks about having periods of intense doubt where he I think the quote was he was a Philosophically depressed guy just lying about not knowing the direction of his life more recently Dr. Seuss goes to dinner with friends after college and he's like what is going on? I'm the only one out of my college group of friends that doesn't know what he's doing in his life And so this is what noises is happening to noise So again when you feel like this just remind yourself it's normal just keep pushing his own life struck him as so bleak That for one of the few times in his life Bob noise openly questioned what he was doing The whole of the visit to my brother served to point out to me how Misdirected I am and think about how absurd he is. He's studying in graduate school at MIT You're doing okay, man. Don't worry about it. But again our mind can play tricks on us These people have some worthwhile goals in life. It doesn't seem to me that I have And now we get to the part my note on this is very simple reading This made me happy this guy cares about noise and this is again Invaluable to us at the end of noises first year of graduate school Nathaniel Frank that's somebody at MIT replied to Gail's letter requesting information about noises performance Mr. Noice has been an outstanding student in all respects We are sufficiently impressed with his potential that we have nominated him for a fellowship in physics for the next academic year And he has received this fellowship you were to be Congratulated on the excellence of the training which has had which he has had and we look forward to an outstanding performance by mr Noice grant gail Kept this letter for his rest of his life So it's around this time that noice develops his lifelong love of skiing and this is how noice learned to ski But really that's not the point The point i'm bringing this to your attention is because everything he does is like this. Remember his nickname was rapid robert So he's like, okay, i'm not gonna start on the bunny slopes I'm gonna go right to the hard part and i'm gonna put myself in uncomfortable positions and force myself to learn noice apparently started On the intermediate runs on the assumptions that said she would end up there soon enough soon enough Why not just skip the bunny slopes and aim high? This is how his brother described it this time bob was not the type to slow down for much of anything Now it was interesting to me at this point bob is going to describe one of his professors And this is the first example of him being the anti shockly noice was interested in other people shockly was not Noice who had a profound distrust of people he thought overly he had excuse me He had a profound distrust of people he thought overly cerebral He once described his professor's mind as perverted Too much wrapped up in his own field and closed to anything else He would sit in silence rather than talk about anything but math go back to the story of shockly Which I found one of the most disgusting things he ever did. He's got an adult son his son buys a magazine Because he knows his father's uh likes to electric electronics and physics Uh, they're in new york and he's talking to him about it on the first day the second. He's like, okay Well, i've had enough about you know physics. Can we go? Let's go drink a beer dad. Let's go watch a movie Let's go do some father and son bonding and shockly his response says I like to teach physics If you want to learn physics, i'll stay if not i'm going back to california leaves the next day and never speaks to his son again terrible person This is noice at 28 years old. He's graduated. He took a job at this company called filco And remember this part At 28 now in five years his life is not going to be like this at 20 years old It says in in august 1955 noice noted my current assets are I have household furnishings for an apartment I have a car valued at 700. I have 300 in the bank I have stocks about 650 bucks and I have a 20 000 life insurance policy my current liabilities other than household running expenses Of about 400 our debts need extent of 500 My wife and children live with me and are wholly dependent on me for their support So remember that's him at 28 essentially doesn't have much his net worth is very close to zero He does have a job and he is supporting his his two. I think he's got One child and a baby on the way and then he's married as well at times and this is where his life starts to intersect Um with shockly so says on january 19th 1956 noice answered his telephone the man at the other end of the line greeted him with Two words shockly here william shockley the inventor of the transistor assumed noice knew who he was and he was right It was like picking up the phone and talking to god noice recalled later He wanted noice to work for him in california So we obviously know he picks up off the east coast moves his entire family at the against his wife's wishes by the way Her family's from New england she wanted to stay in that area and he takes this giant risk It's like hey this guy is the most important person in the transistor field This is what i'm passionate about I have to pursue this opportunity And this is where we're really going to dig into Uh the difference between shockly and noice this is a description of shockly's management style He made it clear to his young team that he would assign them to projects of his choosing to be done as he directed Uh shockly's view that was that unless your thoughts were better than his you have to do it his way Uh, many of them so I didn't know this or maybe I don't think I no I I don't think I knew how close shockly and Um in noice were noice was essentially shockly's right hand man Even though he's much older than noice while they're working at shockly semiconductor noice becomes the de facto leader and the problem is shockly's deficient on Uh trait that noice has an abundance and that's charisma And so it says many of noice's peers felt that they learned more from him him than they did from shockly Shockly strongly adhered to the belief that in almost every aspect of life There should be what but one winner and he wanted to be it so this is what they talk to us like it's very bizarre That you're you're competing with your own team You're going to alienate them if you do that Uh, this is a great way to think about shockly's the culture under shockly and again This is going to be the exact opposite for the companies that noice builds shockly's behavior deteriorated to the point that the lab came to resemble a big psychiatric institute So shockly's company lasts less than a year and a half I covered that uh last week So i'm not gonna i'm gonna skip ahead to where Noice finally makes a decision to jump this is his financial situation at the beginning of fairchild semiconductor noice had no savings This proved to be a problem when arthur rock and bud coil these are the people helping him Uh launch fairchild semiconductor also went into last week Told the group of eight that they needed that they each needed to pay five hundred dollars for an ownership stake in the new company Noice asked his parents to inquire if his grandmother the only member of his family with any financial reserves could lend him the money He promised to repay her with interests and Think about that so not only did they not have an abundance of money right But this is truly remarkable when you when you when you think about I mean you can't have a lot of experience in the transistor industry They didn't have that that's my point Because it's a brand new industry so it says before joining shockly the group of eight had between them Three years of transistor experience and that's the part they knew the product what they were going to do they were going to build transistors They had three years of transistor experience and all that experience resided in bob noice None of them At the time transistors were made out of geranium. I think that's how you pronounce it and they had the idea Hey silicon silicon silicon Is much is a better? Route to take here so it says none of them have ever had ever worked with silicon After less than 18 months with shockly However, the eight were sufficiently competent to start a company that within the space of a decade This is the punchline here that within a space of a decade sold hundreds of millions of dollars of silicon Semiconductor devices and let me quote mark andreson if you don't mind again one of my favorite quotes of his i'm a firm believer That most people who do great things are doing them for the first time They had no money no experience brand new industry and after 18 months of shockly because hey this is the wrong way Within a decade they're gonna sell hundreds of millions of dollars of this brand new device Uh, this is actually a great summary of what happened to shockly and why again I find him so, uh Disgusting of a person In 1963 shockly left industry to join the faculty at stanford where he taught for the next two decades as he aged bitterness and paranoia Came to dominate his once brilliant mind. He became an outspoken eugenic eugenicist who donated this is come on man Who are we dealing with here? He became an outspoken eugenicist who donated his sperm with the stipulation it be supplied only to women who were members of mensa So I forgot that's also in um in last week's book. There's a chapter on There's a guy that thought similar shockly. It's like we have to save the human race by only letting smart people reproduce we we need to Uh, not euthanize. That's the wrong word. Um We need to make sure our uh that essentially dumber people can't out we uh out produce Make more children than smarter people and so with the guy I think that started the sperm bank wound up siring like 200 something children So anyway, it was just a another bizarre thought by shockly. So anyways, uh, you know donating my sperm with this Stipulation only be a supply to women who were of mensa while his protege achieved his goal of earning millions of dollars and seeing Their names in the business press shockly rarely left to stanford home Where he wrote articles on the intellectual inferiority of blacks to whites and the need to institute birth control measures This is what I was trying to say for people with low iq scores small wonder shockly had been called the moses of silicon valley He brought people to the promised land, but he himself was denied entrance Okay, so let's go back to noise. This is another thing that's really important um, so The traitorous eight as of the people that left semi fairchild are assuming They left shockly semiconductor and founded Fairchild semiconductor were called the traitor state. Okay They de facto thought of bob even though they were equal founders as the leader now he is unsure He wants to do scientific work. He does not want to be a leader of people He doesn't he's unsure if he can manage so this is an example of I don't think I have the skills I'm unsure but i'm going to go ahead anyways, which is really important noise was tempted But he feared him ill prepared to oversee an entire company Moreover the prospect of having the final say over the many employees he could one He could imagine one day working for fairchild semiconductor frightened him he's scared he's insecure he goes forward anyway And so something noise was also a fan if he wasn't he was the anti shockly because shockly wanted hierarchy And you know all the ideas come from me genius shockly and you guys do the work noise He didn't want any hierarchy This is something he keeps for his entire life and normally when the company grows to a size where hierarchies may be necessary He usually becomes disinterested or transitions or are um Promote somebody else that can actually enforce that and manage the people but in the early days of fairchild the hierarchy was flat this reminded me of Microsoft if you read the book hard drive founders number 140 if you haven't the first 30 No, it's not the first 30. It's it's the history of microsoft up until the ipo which is I thought the most interesting part But what I was surprised to learn when I read that book is microsoft had a similar flat hierarchy For their first 30 employees it was bill who was essentially the head guy and salesperson which was surprising bill a secretary and 28 programmers we see a very Similar arrangement in the early days of fairchild semiconductor for their founders. It was a very eager tap eagle I can never pronounce this word Eagletarian arrangement that's still not you know the word Noyce was the technical head of the lab and that was it for organizational structure The rest of us were pretty much on equal footing everybody wore as many hats as possible and this is What many people believe the best years of their life And we see this over and over again the very beginning of something when it's small when you know everybody Eventually, you know, you have a lot of success it grows and then once the company grows You know people look back rooffully like wow, I missed a good old date So this is them having the time of their lives the report of the eight of the eight men Of the report that the eight men shared was dynamic They worked together 10 or 12 hours a day not counting the trips to the bar where they like to go For drinks in the evening. They often found themselves standing in a circle when they were together their shoulders nearly touching each man holding one conversation with the man on his left and a different one with the man on his right Noyce loved these moments loved the buzz of talk and the smell of cigarettes many of them held between their lips a formal photo from the founding period Hints at this rapport the eight founders sit around a table. They are seated in a circle with Noyce as always front and center Every man wears a smile big enough to be called a grin They are clearly having the times of their lives. Okay now here we get to a idea You can read between the lines of what Noyce is doing and really the the lesson here is you should do what you're good at and outsource the rest They're brutally methodical labor of science That is the careful working and recording of one's way through experiment after experiment each one only slightly different from the iteration that preceded it Each one only slightly different from the iteration that preceded it interested Noyce far less than the moments when a new idea came to him At his core Noyce was an almost compulsive idea generator a mental perpetual motion machine Thomas Edison famously declared genius to be 99 perspiration and 1 inspiration But Noyce preferred to spend as much time as possible in the inspiration stage, but he's also smart later on When he when he leaves Fairchild semiconductor he decides Him and Gordon Moore and Gordon Moore is famous in his own right. Of course Not only is he a co-founder of Fairchild and Intel just like Noyce But he's also the inventor of Moore's law He says hey, I don't want to be at head at the head anymore So me and you Gordon are going to run the company together and then eventually they have to bring in Andy Grove and realize hey, he's the one that actually Is many people credit with the growth of after the founding of Intel with the actual growth of Intel into the giant company It became because he's the administrator. He's the one that can manage and push the ideas He's the 99 perspiration guy if you want to think about in terms of Edison of Edison's famous quote This is Noyce's approach to inventing His approach Noyce once told a friend was to know the science cold and then forget about it He did not slog or grind his way to ideas. He felt they just came to him When he heard because this is such a great line when he heard Picasso's famous line about artistic artistic creativity I do not seek I find Noyce said that he invented the same way Think about this next paragraph as a good prompt for your thinking In Noyce's opinion, there were only two relevant questions in the earliest stages of scientific innovation And I don't think that this applies to more than just scientific innovation one Why won't this work? And two what fundamental laws will it violate if an idea seen within the realm of physical possibility then Then i almost called him Royce then Noyce deemed it worthy of exploration Conventional wisdom on the topic be damned This is more on how Noyce worked and it is very similar if you've listened to the two podcasts i've done in Edison I have another biography of Edison. Uh that'll be coming next few weeks. Maybe next few months Uh This echoes Edison though the Fairchild researchers did not understand precisely why this innovation worked I've omitted what they're working on because it's not important. Here's the main lesson in an academic environment This question would have been paramount We want to know why it works right at Fairchild semiconductor Why something work was far less important than the fact that it did In a newborn company with only one customer of any significance. This is IBM at the time pursuing science for its own sake Was an ill-afforded luxury. They don't they don't have giant resources. They will one day but they don't at this stage You can't do that. Thus early research at a Fairchild semiconductor was almost all process oriented with building a sellable product The fundamental goal if you studied Edison, you know, that's exactly that he could have said that It's exactly how he went about it. Noyce believed that the only thing that's technologically exciting is something that has a need for it Another way Edison could have easily said that for some reason when I read this section it made me think of there's a I've told you before I have all these quotes in this folder on my phone that I just go through and They spur thoughts, right? And one of it was a tweet and it says business is like nature It doesn't care if you arrive at the right answer from the wrong reasoning Evolution demands survival. It doesn't ask you to show your work This is more on how Noyce worked Uh, he talks about you know, there's not like does it it's not like I don't have a eureka movement. It's all iterative I don't have any recollection of a boom. There it is the light bulb going off Noyce later said of his ideas instead he conceived of the integrated circuit in an iterative method Uh, I thought let's see if we could do this. Okay, we can do that if we can do that Then we can do this It was a logical sequence if I hit a wall i'd back up and then find a path Conceptually all the way through to the end once you have that path you can come back and start refining Thinking in little this is the main point his punch line right here Thinking in little steps will take you there Now this is more on the anti-shock. It's funny in my notes throughout the entire book I'm constantly writing down anti-shockley anti-shockley anti-shockley and then the the later on the the uh, the author leslie Actually uses that term so I felt a little bit of indication there He had not changed his managerial approach since his days at shockley He still displayed the same tendencies to make suggestions This is again how smart are you if you don't understand that if you were going to accomplish anything great You're gonna have to work with other people so that means you have to learn the people skills, right? Go back to the very end of the book. I don't know when I did it Maybe in the 30s ed catmull co-founder of pixar wrote this great book creativity inc, right? He's the person that worked the longest with steve jobs in at the end of that book He has an entire epilogue chapter called the steve we knew and it talks about this common perception that steve was just this This infant I forgot what he called like infant dictator something like that They're like he would you do what when you hear descriptions? Yes, steve could be a jerk an ass whatever you want to call it Of course But a lot of the stories you hear is from when he was younger He's like when we saw him grow in the 26 years that I worked with steve jobs He didn't have people skills when he was younger He got kicked out of apple because he didn't have people skills, but he learned them He matured as he got older and so that's why I have so much beef with shockley It's because like how smart are you really if you never actually learned that you have to deal with people Bob noyce was gifted Had a gifted way with people his entire life steve jobs did not he had to learn how to do that All right, so it says um, he's and this is again more about the just Things I want to to copy bob about he had not changed his managerial approach since his days at shockley He still displayed the same tendency to make suggestions So he'd say why don't you try or have you considered rather than issue commands, which is what shockley did He led the weekly lab meeting but to outward appearances the meetings ran themselves Bob reviewed monthly progress reports for each of his half dozen research groups and determined which innovations were sufficiently novel and potentially lucrative enough to Merit his attorney's fees and hours of work necessary to patent them But he did all of this in such close consultation with his subordinates subordinates that they felt they worked with him Not for him. There's many examples of the same thing the same idea in the book Noyce believed that people given enough freedom will choose to do the right thing This is more ideas on management and more anti-shockley noyce was a very good supervisor of technical people Precisely because he was casual and didn't interfere with his researcher's work Creative freedom and collaboration which proved crucial to the young company's technical success Blossomed under noyce's laissez-faire management of the lab. We're still in the fairchild semiconductor days, but he does the same thing at intel So as the company starts growing, it's one of the fastest companies ever in american business And so the the people that own the company because remember it's a small company within a larger company of sherman fairchild's empire They're like they keep pushing bob like bob come more into the management aspect and again He's reluctant to move into the executive side of things It was with a great deal of a fear of inadequacy. Listen to the words that he's using there It was a with a great deal of fear of inadequacy that I got into an administrative role So much fear in fact that he would agree only to a six-month trial run as a general manager They're trying to promote him. He's like no stop. I don't want to do this. Okay, i'll do it But for six months after which he planned to return to the lab. He does not return to the lab More anti-shockley and it's a powerful idea I'm really it's an illustrate last week was an illustration of this idea you and I talked about over and over again Learn how to do something by seeing it done the wrong way Study, I think it was chapter nine in that book Uh, I think the title is a peculiar ideas of managing people or motivating people I don't have in front of me, but you if you listen to last week, you know what it is Read that chapter and then do the opposite And it's very powerful Noyce's top objective was to keep Fairchild from becoming Shockley semiconductor labs a place He called the model of what not to do Noyce explained how he loathed Shockley's mind games his top-down approach to management and his habit of playing one employee off another Above all, Noyce wanted to lead not through command and control methods, but by inspiring the voluntary cooperation of motivated people uh, so within Remember I asked you to think about his financial situation and state of his life at 28. This is at 33 Uh, because Shockley had this this um, not Shockley, uh, Sherman Fairchild had this uh, stipulation in the contract that say if things are going well I can buy out the founders and own 100 of this company that i'm kind of incubating and they do that So remember he couldn't he had brought 500 bucks from his grandmother to start the company winds up selling Partial interest to like like three hundred thousand dollars this happens within the first three years So it says at 33 Noyce now had more money than he or anyone else in his family had ever possessed More money than he could ever imagine spending. It's funny that he thought about that at that age Uh, and no real failures, uh, and no real failures to make him caution. So again a lot can change in five years Uh, just some random ideas that I thought was really interesting and something that really his main point here Absent the religious part is what founders is all about. It's a celebration of unique individuals and the power that one person can have Uh, Noyce did not talk much about religion even though he was a minister's son though He did on one occasion point out that the aunt this is such a unique way. I've never heard this described Uh christianity described like this, uh, though He did on one occasion point out the entrepreneurial and motivational messages latent in the christmas story Which he appreciated as a reminder that one event Or one man can suspend can substantially change the course of history Going back more to this idea about being the anti-shockly people love noise That's why he was able to because of the way he treated them He got more out of out of them right Noyce once said that the job of the manager isn't an enabling Not a directive job. He says it's to enable them. Isn't that interesting? Coaching and not direction is the first quality of leadership. This is all quotes from Noyce Get the barriers out of the way to let people do things. They do well He had adopted this approach when he ran the lab and as general manager he continued it He wrote personal this is the main point of why i'm telling you this section He wrote personal notes to researchers whose work impressed him He poked his head into employees offices to thank them for their work And said it sincerely enough that one man so complex Complimented compared the experience to a hundred percent raise Yes money motivates people. Absolutely But noise understood humans on a fundamental level being valued part being Realizing that what you do is value to the people you work with is more meaningful That doesn't mean you skimp on the pay. It just means that humans over the long term There's a diminishing return on finances, right? There's not a diminishing return on appreciation Another lesson here if you hired smart people, why are you not listening to them? This is more anti-shockly behavior. Noyce had wandered through the main semiconductor building Admiring aloud the family photos that employees had on their desks He would stop to talk to anyone about anything and knew many details of him of his employees personal lives Noyce liked to gather a group of informed people in a room Listen to their opinions and ideally get a broad acceptance on the next steps before he made a decision He talks about like the direction your company should be directed by the people are most knowledgeable not just the senior people It's not high art. He says it's not an issue of hierarchy. It's an issue of knowledge One of my favorite quotes from edwin land Uh, obviously i've done five podcasts on edwin land. I I still make the argument He's one of the most important entrepreneurs in history, even though he would describe himself as a scientist not an entrepreneur He says optimism is a moral duty I'm attracted to optimism and passion and I don't think i'm alone in that and it's an example of that uh He Noyce had both optimism Uh and passion he says well he would start meetings or an interaction with somebody he says hey what's new and exciting today Noyce forever looked to the future and its technical promise In 1965 for example, this is crazy because in 1965 he's he's predicting the world that we live in now, right in 1965 for example He told a gathering of financial analysts that he expected one day to see integrated circuits inside of portable telephones personal paging systems and palm-sized tvs That's a smartphone Noyce's focus on the future and innovation appealed to the creative instincts of many fairchilds Semiconductor employees and permeated the company in the mid 1960s fairchild semiconductor was not a typical semiconductor company Andy groves already working with them. He's obviously going to go to intel as well It says andy grove once described fairchild as a strange little upstart a phrase that captures the essence of the organization Noyce's unorthodox management style was just one innovation launched at fairchild in the lab Informal company policy allowed phd's to play with their ideas for about a year before expecting results If an idea appealed to a researcher for whatever reason he was free to pursue it This rather loose definition of relevance led fairchild's researchers to develop roughly 1-6 this is crazy. They developed 1-6 of all major integrated circuit innovations during the technology's first two decades The best way this is to quote from noyce the best way to get something done is to have enough confidence in yourself and your men to do it A young another advice a young organization, especially in the electronics industry has to be fast moving Now this is noyce describing the time at fairchild We were a hard young hungry group. Our attitude was we don't give a damn what money you have to offer buddy We're going to do it ourselves And this is the result by 1968 fairchild employed some 4 000 people in 140 000 square feet of plant space outside the united states 40 times more people and 11 times more building space than they had in five years. That's crazy 40 times more people in five years 11 times more space in five years That's an example of the quote. I always say again quoting mark and reese and a lot today A great market pulls the product out of you. He makes the counterintuitive assertion that Most people think the team is most important the product is most important He says you can choose between product team or market which is most important for your success mark saying that market is most important A great market pulls the product out of you more on the management culture than noyce Created the management culture culture noyce inspired provided rich sustenance for the young bright self-motivated types that semiconductors That a fairchild semiconductor courted For these men fresh out of school and eager to make their mark the freedom to do their jobs in a way that they believe Best was a fantastic reward to have noyce the head of the company listened carefully to their ideas was exciting in itself One of my favorite quotes out of any book That I read was this guy named henry kaiser And he wound up finding over 100 companies helped build the hoover dam I'm currently listening to the audiobook and it'll eventually be a podcast on the founders postscript feed That patrick collison of stripe Recommended petrick collison's just crazy thinking. I know he's just very anytime I hear him speak. He's really Unique thinker and so when he recommends a book, I think it's a good idea that should read it but anyways, i'm into this book And there's a bunch of people that have already been podcasts on because it's about how did us industry cooperation between um academia industry and government produce all the necessary, uh Material to help win world war two and anyways kaiser's in this book That's why I was thinking of him, but he says something that's fabulous and he says problems are just opportunities in work clothes And so this what i'm about to read you. I think I feel noyce would agree with that sentiment. So problem are just Opportunities in workloads. What are you panicking for? As a manager noyce remained calm in the face of potential disasters that had others panicking I remember we lost a process at the diode plant said one employee. We simply lost it I mean like all of a sudden it just didn't work anymore. I said to bob my god, this is terrifying Oh my god. Oh my god. We're gonna die He said oh no, we'll figure it out. He was completely relaxed about it. It was wonderful and calming to me Noyce could also be brutally competitive He saw he repeatedly sought out shockly out the shockly booth at an industry trade show So that he could tell his former boss we at fairchild semiconductor are going to bury you But for the people on his team, this was an asset Noyce's greatest strength as a manager was that he gave people confidence in themselves Partly this came from his undeniable evidence of his own success a technical man who made it big on the strength of raw intelligence and unusual ideas And this is one of his unusual ideas And I would I think many people gordon moore to really who i'm stealing this sentiment from would say it's Noyce is one of noyce's best ideas All right, so it says the selling of new ideas is really an engineering problem noyce once said To him it was obvious that despite their other purported concerns about the integrated circuit customers primary objective to the new technology was its costs Had not every other issue been handled. So we also see as he goes through he's like why aren't these selling yet? Okay, and he goes through like these are all these other possible reasons that they're not selling and then he eliminates them one by one And he realizes hey, it's the cost and this is what he does about it A glitzier marketing program would not turn more customers to the integrated circuit The buyers were extremely technically sophisticated if their technical objections had been met and they were still not buying The problem had to be the price tag Accordingly noyce made a little disgust but absolutely critical decision Fairchild would sell its low end integrated circuits for less than it would cost a customer to buy the individual components and connect them themselves and this is the important part Less than it was costing fairchild to build the device So you're going to sell something for less than it costs you to make why gordon moore calls this move? Bob's unheralded contribution to the semiconductor industry notice. He did not say to fairchild. He said to the entire industry When a fairchild distributor asked noyce if combining the function of several transistors on one integrated circuit and then selling that integrated circuit for less Than any of than any one of the individual transistors was a was a sure path to corporate suicide Noyce simply smiled in a way that made it clear. He did not think so in effect Noyce was betting fairchild's bottom line against two hunches One he suspected that if integrated circuits could make their way into the market Customers would prefer them to discrete components and would begin designing their products around his new device Two he also calculated that his fairchild built mill built more and more Experience curves and economies of scale would enable the company eventually to build the circuits for so little That it would be possible to make a profit even on the seemingly ridiculously low price Gordon moore this is the most important part of the section Gordon moore has said that noyce's decision to lower prices to stimulate demand So that the production volume could grow and the cost of production be decreased accordingly Was as important an invention for the industry as the integrated circuit itself It established a new technology of the semiconductor industry that holds true till today gordon explained Whenever there's a problem you lower the price This was as revolutionary a concept to people within fairchild as it was to their customers So at this point fairchild is one of the fastest growing company companies in the country And this is like the fifth time how many times i'm gonna quote this guy and another quote from mark andresen that's in um I think it's in ben horowitz book the hard thing about hard things Uh andresen says what he likes the most about startups is that in a startup you only experience two emotions euphoria and fear He's also telling you that it's perfectly normal if you're feeling that way For noyce the energy and growth were incredibly seductive Piloting fairchild through its acceleration noyce told a friend was a bit like riding a fast horse The same combination of exhilaration and fear So he's using the words exhilaration and fear mark andresen's using euphoria and fear same idea and teetering on the edge of losing control But never quite doing so Now what's interesting though again, he's a very unique person, but nobody's perfect. He's experiencing simultaneous Unprecedented career success and an unhappy home life his marriage. He's got a he's been married almost 20 years at this point And he's got four kids and his marriage is falling apart noyce was powerful attractive and unhappy at home He was a risk taker who believed in grabbing as much from life as he could and he was in regular contact with other women He had casual affairs Noyce knew that he was becoming a stranger to his own family He said he envied people out in the machine shop who could go home at night and sleep with no concern He was appalled to discover that the longer he stayed at fairchild the less he had any interest in doing anything except business What are you as a person when that happens? He asked then he answered his own question You're nothing And he goes through this for several years Until he eventually gets divorced. He does wind up getting remarried and he stays with his second wife until he dies But this is something that he looks at as like a personal failure in his life and you'll see Based on the advice that he gives to other people later on Um at this point in the story i'm fast forwarding he he leaves intel And this is where another idea is it's very smart to know your weaknesses And this is why andy grove was so important intel one thing I learned at fairchild is that I don't run large organizations As well, I don't have the discipline to do that. I don't have the follow-through My interests and skills are in a different place. It's getting people together to do something, but that only works for me in a smaller group So this is not only was andy grove important, but really he picked the best partner That's a really good idea him and him and gordon moore were in many respects perfect compliments of one another And so this is a little bit about that. They had worked together productively for more than a decade Thanks to the remarkably complementary skills where noyce saw the big picture more more More could discern detail When noyce had honed his abilities to construct strong connections between fairchild and various outside constituencies The press the board customers suppliers and so on more had become an expert leader within the company itself Noyce rarely set foot in the lab after 1965 But moore had an intensely loyal following in rnd and his grove was loyal to moore not noyce And so moore was responsible for bringing grove over so you cannot under understate the impact and the importance moore was noyce gets all the attention But moore was very very important to the to the success intel had and fairchild And for all their different appearance and all their apparent differences, excuse me Noyce and moore shared one key trait a burning competitive desire to do something Extraordinary well extraordinarily. Well This is andy grove on bob noyce at the beginning because again, this is no one's perfect And he's going to show us a lot of the traits that he felt noyce was lacking in Grove alone among the group planning to leave fairchild with noyce and moore had serious doubts about its leadership. He did not like bob noyce Grove who had attended noyce's staff meetings was shocked to see how noyce let people bite into each other like rabid dogs Uh bob just sat there at his meetings. He wore a pained expression and a slight somewhat appropriate smile His looks said either children, would you please behave or I want to be anywhere but here Noyce refused to take charge irritated grove who but this is why I think is even if I really feel one of the best books I've read for the podcast Is andy grove's memoir memoir swimming across it only talks about the first 20 years of his life And it's just a wonderfully it's an unbelievable story and just wonderful writing, but we get a summary here Uh grove by the time he was 20 years old had hidden in a cellar to elude the nazis Fled the communist takeover hungary and crossed the atlantic to the united states where a few years later He graduated first an engineering class despite having begun his coursework without knowing how to say horizontal or vertical in english Grove had little respect for a man who in his estimation did not argue but just suffered Now here's something remarkable for you. Even after all the success he founded and piloted one of the fastest growing companies In america in american history, right? He's he still has lingering doubts at the beginning of intel and here's what his mindset was several of the fair children That's what everybody so a bunch of people left fairchild semiconductor and started companies They traced like 65 or something like that companies direct from direct descendants of that one company Several of the fair children had had failed rather Spectacularly and hoff. This is a guy that noice is trying to recruit Who's younger than him and hoff wanted to know why this venture would not follow suit Noice had asked himself that same question. He had briefly wondered if he and more were too old Noice was 40 and more was 39 to start a company Moreover as noice as much as noice longed to get close to advanced technology again He was concerned that perhaps he had been away for too long to jump back in the game After a bit of thought, however, he decided that his and more's age if reconsidered his experience was an asset As he put it the semiconductor business hadn't existed longer than we had been in it There wasn't anybody who knew the business better than we did So he's raising money for intel which is relatively easy He wanted the board his former college to invest warren buffett on the board as well This was surprising even warren buffett who joined the grinnell board shortly before the decision to invest in intel was made Was willing to abandon one of his fundamental rules of investing only put money into things you understand for this particular instance as buffett put it We were betting on the jockey not the horse Um, this is another example. We saw this too um Just you know, don't if you have some kind of advantage don't go blabbering your mouth Don't tell people what your strategy is if them knowing a strategy would help them So says intel was going to try to build semiconductors not of the types of integrated circuits now in the market And the intel would seek to extend the technology to higher levels of integration the word memory, which is what they were doing Never appeared in the plan Frankly said noice we didn't want people to know what we were going to be doing We thought it would attract too many competitors too soon Secretly was essential for noices and more's plan to work Intel scientists did not give talks that would benefit competitors. That's essentially the main point Don't say something keep your mouth shut if it's going to benefit your competitors away I reduced this I compressed this into an aphorism bad boys move in silence, which is not my aphorism pretty sure I stole that from Biggie Smalls the the the rapper But that's a good way to think about this. This is also something that was similar in founders number 110 On henry singleton Claude shannon who was on the board of teledyne Was talking about the fact that henry shut up that we did not go around blabbing to our giving our competitors information Just because it's strokes are ego. We get attention in the press He says he always he gives us claude shannon talking about how henry singleton ran his company He always tries to work out the best moves and maybe he doesn't like to talk too much because when you're playing a game You don't tell anyone else what your strategy is so what claude shannon is talking about is Doing a teledyne you see bob noyce and gordon more doing the same thing at intel And so one of the reasons they wanted to leave fairchild 2 is because it uh, they weren't They started getting input for the people that ran the main fairchild company Not just a semiconductor part of it and they it started to slow things down and so Bob's going to give us some great advice here, but I I don't think it's just about work I think this is great life advice actually and he says when someone says What where fairchild had lumbered in the last few years noyce and more wanted intel to race This is what he said use money to buy time because money is cheaper than time That can be applied to many different things and it made me think of this quote from naval ravikant Who's founder angelist some of you might know who he is and he says guard your time. It's all you have Money has a discount rate as you get older you can get a discount on your time Money has a discount rate as you get older that discount rate goes up when you're about to die The discount rate may be 100 percent Most people would give up everything for one more week or one more year And this last sentence is the most important part live accordingly So I love that let's go back to what noyce just told us use money to buy time because money is cheaper than time And this is a great metaphor by gordon more that it came across Being first to and also indicates why they had to be one be quiet and two move fast, right? Being first to market would put intel in the position of what gordon more called a rifleman who shoots at a blank wall Finds the bullet hole and then paints the target around it The first company in the market always hits the bull's eye because that company can draw the target around its own shot Doesn't mean it's obviously always gonna be the winner, right? Any late arrivals find the target already in place the market defined by someone else More on moving the importance of moving quickly And I just love this idea after observing william schockley's methods of using simplifying assumptions to speed up his company's research Noyce had come to believe that scientists could approach their work in two very different ways So researchers could adopt the pretty approach in which they devote a great deal of time and effort to developing a technique or machine That will allow them to test their ideas with exact measurements that yield final definitive answers or This is his route A researcher could try the quick and dirty way moving forward with an idea as soon as rather Excuse me moving forward with an idea as soon as a rather rudimentary rudimentary test indicates It will probably work noyce believed the quick and dirty method generated 90% of the answer in 10% of the time go back to that. What what award did he win in high school? The person that got the They got the best grades in the least amount of time Okay, he disdained the pretty method as a bit like telling a soccer player never to kick the ball until you have an idea shot All so you have an idea shot all carefully lined up and know exactly how hard and and you know exactly how hard to kick the ball 90 minutes may be over before you locate that opportunity and he's going to extend this later on in the book and I Summarize this is don't over plan steer the boat a little every day I don't get my kicks out of seeing things run at the highest level efficiency with the greatest degree of control He said control immediately means a loss of personal freedom for either the people in the factory or for the management Once you've got once you've set down the ground rules for return on investment or earnings before taxes You are suddenly cut off from some of the choices you could have made So he's not again if you take that route, you're not optimizing for optionality I guess what i'm saying is that the venture part of management rather than the control part of management is more fun to me He added another point this immature what he's calling immature management Has been much more successful for him than the man than the mature management that tried to get into the semiconductor business Let me quote the great henry singleton again. This is from the book disinforce, which I covered in founders number 110 Once criticized for not having a business plan Henry replied that he knew that a lot of people running companies had very definitive plans. They followed assiduously But we're subject to a great number of outside influences on our businesses and most of them can't be predicted So my plan is to stay flexible. That's all bob is saying my only plan is to keep coming to work every day I like to steer the boat each day rather than play rather than plan way ahead into the future Okay, so here's another great idea from steve jobs And it relates to intel just had a major technological breakthrough. They're calling the 1103. It's brand new, but it's not working Well, so it's not a perfect problem product it fails from time to time But it was a technological breakthrough. Okay, that's what you need to understand to understand what jobs is going to say here And so steve jobs perfectly describes the expected human reaction to an imperfect new technology, right? Even with its problems the 1103 represented a real technological breakthrough This is what steve jobs says as steve jobs once said when the light bulb was invented people did not complain that it was too dim I referenced this idea earlier That any sort of hierarchy But especially one that placed noise at the top made him nervous and he wants to optimize for knowledge over hierarchy At intel nose spoke of hierarchy power and knowledge power and firmly believed that when it came to technical decisions The word of the person with the most knowledge ought to trump the opinions of the one with the higher title Shockingly believed the opposite or maybe didn't believe the opposite. He thought okay if i'm at the top of hierarchy That means I have the top of the knowledge and we know that's obviously not true another great idea own up to your mistakes Accept your blame and then fix it Uh mike mark. Coola who ends up owning 30% of apple or something like that Joined intel's marketing group recalls how noise often diffused problems Bob was just so straightforward and didn't try to sweep things under the carpet. He'd say so he's talking about problems with customers, right? He'd say we know what the problem is. We're fixing it. Here's when we'll get it fixed We're doing everything humanly possible to meet your requirements. And yes, we goofed up You know when you're that honest and that's straightforward it's hard for the customer to continue to be angry I'm gonna go back right before his divorce. I want to go back to the you know, this idea things are not always as they appear Intel's going well bob is admired and respected as industry. He's richer than he ever thought possible He just went the intel went public in his divorce. His wife's gonna get like 25 million dollars It gives you an idea of how substantial his net worth had grown but even that even though Everything is going right his marriage is difficult and happy and listen to what he says about it staring straight ahead No, he said almost to himself boy Sometimes it's simpler to get on a plane to new york than to go home He later told his daughter that he used to sit in the intel parking lot for five or ten minutes every evening Idling the motor and wishing there was somewhere he could get he could go that was not his house So eventually he's gonna get to the point where intel's growing and this is where more is going to take over cr Groves gonna come in eventually grove takes over that role as well And you just you know I think one thing is you have to know who you are And noice understood what he loved most and when his companies grew out of that stage where he thought he was most effective And he wasn't happy anymore He moved on and that's that happens in intel too noice had been an ideal founding president for intel because he was at his core What more called a wild expansionist? The job noice enjoyed and excelled at were plotting new products brainstorming new ideas Establishing a market from thin air Meshed perfectly with intel's needs as a young company He loved he said leading a company walking the thin line next to the cliff of disaster His eyes always scanning for the next opportunity And I gotta draw your attention because I don't know if you know this but noice died rather young He died unexpectedly at 62 and he he smoked cigarettes since he was a kid and he had a lifelong two-pack a day habit And this is another example that smart people are capable of doing dumb things This is on his inability to quit smoking several people including one of noice's daughters have said that somewhere deep within himself Noice thought he was immortal Noice never stopped at the edge of a precipice But instead ran at full speed right over the edge and into the unknown This had been his approach with ideas with companies with skiing with driving with women and with inventing How on earth could something as mundane and trivial as a cigarette kill someone like him So after intel he starts doing a lot of investing and restocking The the stream which he fished from as he put it and this is a summary of bob's angel investing He says that's an impossible task. Let's do it Noice like to say you can only lose 100 percent, but the multiples on the upside are fantastic So that's a very quick two sentences and what he's telling you is cap your downside, right? But leave your upside uncapped. This is another example Of a similar idea. This is not a unique idea by any means but it is a very valuable idea Jeff Bezos has his own idea about this and he uses this at amazon He says listen the difference between baseball and business is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution When you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can get is four So what he's saying is the upside is capped in business Every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score a thousand runs And this is when as he's advising these new entrepreneurs trying to help the community that he benefited from We get advice from an older wiser bob noice. I've read the same paragraph in so many different places and um It's very important. I'm going to include it again here in 1979 noice was invited to dinner at the home of an entrepreneur whose company his fund has supported After the dishes had been cleared and the children were sent to bed noice listened as the company founder explained that someday If the business did well, he would like to move his family into a bigger nicer house Noice looked up at him and said very quietly You've got a nice family I screwed up mine Just stay where you are 25 years later and a successful 25 years and a successful company later the entrepreneur Entrepreneur had not moved And this next part, I don't know if he knew this explicitly but I definitely think we do Um, this is extremely important his financial success directly benefited the entrepreneurs whose companies he funded but the stories About noice's success inspired many more when I I highlight this part. Yes, exactly One entrepreneur put it this way. Why do we love this dynamic environment? I'll tell you why because we've seen what we have seen with Steve jobs Bob noice nolan bushnell and many others have done and we know it can and will happen many times again In other words if they could do it, why can't we? Such rationale function as a self-fulfilling prophecy propelling the region forward on a self-perpetuating cycle of entrepreneurship and wealth And so this is what he was doing he was also working in this this collaboration with the government and other semiconductor um companies to try to save the semiconductor industry from foreign competition I admitted that whole part He was doing a job. He didn't really want to do And unfortunately, that's what he was working on when he died unexpectedly and this is just a reminder that we don't know how much time we have So we got to go we got to do what we want to do Two days after the photo was taken they held like a bob noice day at this company that he was working with, you know Celebrate him two days after the photo was taken. He laid down for a rest after his regular morning swim As he slept he suffered a massive heart attack that took his life The date was june 3rd 1990 and noice was 62 years old And before I close this is the eulogy issued from apple obviously apple couldn't have existed without All the people that benefited not only noice but a bunch of people that worked at intel fairchild semiconductor helped Apple in the early days and this is their eulogy for bob noice which I thought was a great summary of the man And it said he was one of the giants in this valley who provided the model and inspiration for everything we wanted to become He was the ultimate inventor the ultimate rebel the ultimate entrepreneur And this is where I'll close noice's most enduring legacy cannot be measured in buildings accolades awards honors Not in dollars earned or given away Not in stock price or market share It cannot be etched in silicon or printed on microchips There is an informal sort of generational succession in silicon valley that places noice near the top of the family tree And even when there is no such explicit tie back to noice Even if the latest generation of entrepreneurs don't know his name His influence endures in a set of ideals that have become an indelible part of american high tech culture his spirit Quietly urging anyone who might listen to go off And do something wonderful To get the full story.
