Leon has could recite the margins of every gasoline station on the east coast john mackie the founder of whole foods could do the same for every whole foods store actually spent a few days john mackie he told me what the craziest things that anyone is ever said about the podcast. He listened over hundred episodes before we met and he told me the founders existed when he was younger whole foods is still be independent company that since the podcast and all of his business constantly emphasize the importance of controlling expenses. He would put more of a priority on it especially during good times during boom times three natural for company and for human nature to just not watch your causes closely because everything is going so well this is something that history's greatest founders would warn against. In fact andrew carnegie will repeat this mantra time and time again he would say profits and prices were cyclical subject to any number of transient forces of the marketplace. Cost however could be strictly controlled and any savings achieved in cost were permanent. This is something that i was talking about my friend eric who's the co-founder and ceo of ramp ramp is now the presenting sponsor of this podcast i've gotten to know all the co-founder ramp. I spent a bunch of time with them over the last year to the podcast they've all picked up on the fact that the main theme from the podcast is on the importance of watching your costs and controlling your span. How doing so can give you a massive competitive advantage that is a main theme for ramp the reason that ramp exists is to give you everything you need to control your spend ramp gives you everything you need to control your cost ramp gives you easy to use corporate cards for your entire team. Automated expense reporting and cost control cost control is a very important line in andrew carnegie's biography which says cost control became nearly an obsession ramp helps you do the same ramp helps you run an efficient organization ramp is everything you need. To control your span and optimize all of your financial operations on a single platform ramps website is incredible make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business control costs as a ramp.com. One more tool that i want to tell you about is a vesto a lot of my friends are using vesto to see all of their company accounts in one view. Vesto helps you connect and control all of your business bank accounts from one dashboard i know the founder ben we spent a bunch of time together and i offered to help him by introducing him to some my friends that i feel could benefit from best so i call my friends. He told me david i will meet with anyone that you want me to but i have to tell you that we say no to over ninety percent of the software that we are pitched and yet a week later here back from a friend he says ben and vesto are great and that they signed up. So i asked my friend ago can you ask your team to explain the benefit they get from vesto in their own words so i'm going to read you this text message exchange this is the response back this is his team explaining the benefit they get from vesto in their own words. It provides us the ability to view all of our bank accounts and loan accounts on one platform with a single sign on it makes it much easier to grant access to users in one place as opposed to twenty different banks i text back what did they do before vesto. We have twenty plus different bank logins across like five accounts we literally use twenty one banks so every bank has an account and a loan that multiple people need access and views to just to log in and see everything would take hours and be in different tabs so if you have. Multiple accounts and multiple businesses go to vesto and schedule a demo with the founder ben tell him david sent you that is vesto with a V so vesto dot com the link will also be down in the show notes i hope you enjoyed this episode leon has was a remarkable person who led a remarkable life. The book that one talk to you about today is called has the last oil baron and is written by tina davis and jessica resnick all to actually want to start at the very end of the book in the book to authors actually talk about why they decided to spend so much time. Setting life of leon has some why they thought writing the book was really important is that we think this extraordinary man live in extraordinary life the reason we call has the last oil baron is that we believe him to be the last of his kind. The last man who create a multi billion dollar multinational vertically integrated energy behemoth that could do everything from finding oil and far flung fields of the coast of indonesia to selling you a tank of gas and a pack of gum at the local station on the corner. 16 years after his death leon's legacy is starting to be erased from popular memory this book is an attempt to capture his life the company created the man he was in the ways in which his life in industry changed the nation he should not disappear from public view after reading the book after spending the last several days re reading all my notes and all my highlights. Should not disappear from public view i want to start the story of leon has i think the best way to start the story of leon has is actually talking about his father and really the failures of his father's or her father that led to in large part the lead to the success of his son. I always think of this maximum that repeats throughout the history of entrepreneurship that you can always understand the son by the story of his father the story of the father is embedded in the sun so leon's dad. What's a failed entrepreneur said leon's dad dabble in many things but never had great success at any of them he had strong entrepreneur energy and he tried his hand a lot of things he tried to sell produce any open a bunch of butcher shops and he tried in real estate and finally tried to deliver coal so leon's dad. Begins a small coal distribution business in new jersey this is very important without his dad doing this and then leon realizing that they were in the wrong business there would not be no pass oil corporation. So during the great depression leon's dad actually goes bankrupt and as a result of this leon's family is unable to send him to college he's the youngest son the three older children all get to go to school. So even though leon never went to college he later succeeds in a cut throat and highly technical business despite lacking a quote unquote formal education. There's a series of odd jobs at leon does and leon's brothers do try to help the family survive that the great depression. One of them is they would go down to the jersey shore and actually dig up clams and then sell the clams to local restaurants so they would work all day and they'd be lucky to make 50 to 75 cents a day from digging up clams. What are the benefits that leon gets from being a kid and working for his father in a coal yard delivering calls that he got you see he was accustomed to handing a large workload. It says the hard labor at the coal yard helped shape leon's ethic of working long hours he worked every weekend you'll see even when he has a giant. I you know vertically integrated oil company he would still work tirelessly all the time there's stories of you know him popping up a plants at two in the morning to check on things to make sure everything's going well. Now there's something that's I think this is one of the most important parts of the book is he's gonna start this company at 19 years old right he's gonna get into the fuel delivery business so. The reason I think this is one of the most important parts of leon's life story is because leon realizes that his dad picked the wrong business. This also shows how shrewd and smart leon was from a young age because he's like the coal business is a dead end we're hauling these hundred pound bags of coal and the profit margin is tiny. And with what might be one of the most important ideas leon ever has arguably the most important idea ever has he decides he's gonna. Switch from delivering coal to delivering fuel oil so I get to this part of the book leon reminded me of sam bronfman so sam bronfman and leon has both started multi-billion dollar family dynasties. And both started by fixing the mistakes of their father so I did not know who sam bronfman was I didn't know about the bronfman family. Many many years ago I'm actually reading this is all the way back on episode 53 I was reading Mike over its is excellent autobiography which is called who is my go it's in in that book it talks about Mike is my goal of its is brokering a deal. Between seagram which is the bronfman's family company seagram buys mca universal for five point seven billion dollars and so that led me to start researching the bronfman family I find out the patriarch of the bronfman family is this guy named sam bronfman I find his biography. I read it and then I'd make an episode this is episode one sixteen six seven years ago. And in that episode is the very first time that I use the phrase generational inflection point which is this idea that a single individual can change the trajectory of his entire. Family for generations to come sam bronfman was that in the bronfman family dynasty leon has is that for the leon is for the has family. So in that there the reason I thought of this when I was reading about leon has and I got to the section of the book is because sam's a young kid working in the family business hit any realizes that his dad is doing it wrong is that has the wrong idea so sam's dad sold horses. And every time and seems like a little kid when the seven and so what and sam's you know following his dad around and working the family business very similar to what leon trying to do with his father father when he was really young. And so every time. Sam's dad was sell a horse he would take the customer to a bar for a celebratory drink and young sam realizes hey dad on the wrong side of this transaction we're in the wrong business the guy selling us. The drink is making more money than the guy selling the horse and that observation that single observation single idea that the young sam bronfman has changed the bronfman family forever same proceeds to create. I goes on and creates you know the world's largest liquor distilling firm they branch out to all kinds of different businesses to this day the family you know hundred hundred fifty years later hundred twenty years later however long it's been. Is still you know one of the wealthiest families in the world so leon realizes dad were in the wrong business and proceeds to switch the product to so leon season opportunity. And he's like i'm gonna bet on oil specifically fuel oil instead of coal as a more economical way to get energy so in his own words later on there's only a few quotes from the is very quiet person. He says he started a little oil company so he starts his little oil company in nineteen thirty three leon is nineteen years old. And as leon describes this you couldn't start from more humble beginnings his his entire oil company his fuel companies fuel delivery service. He says i bought a secondhand truck and i started selling heating oil and i built this company up over a number of years so nineteen thirty three nineteen years old one used truck. That is going to be the beginning of the house family dynasty so he is going to find buyers for residual oil that refiners didn't want what is residual oil that refiner's didn't want this is gonna remind you are reminding me at least. Sam's a Murray in the book the fish to eat the well you could think of the same business the same way that sam's a Murray built his business is the same way that leon has built his business. In the sense that they discovered opportunity hiding in plain sight literally the product that both of both sam's a Murray and leon has to sell was just being thrown away. This is one of the most important parts of the book and of leon's life so leon realizes that he could sell was called number six fuel oil it's called residual oil it's called black oil is that you it's this heavy almost like molasses. Thick oil that other refiners are just throwing away so leon's plan is a i'm gonna take this seven year old secondhand use truck right it's it holds six hundred fifteen gallons. Of oil i'm gonna go collect this fuel that you're throwing away anyway so he gets a good deal on it from area refineries in new jersey and then repurpose it as a cleaner alternative to call so what he realizes that they call light refining it's really like essentially boiling. Just boiling this black oil this fuel oil you could actually then go and resell it so he sells it to businesses and manufacturers use it to as heating oil so he sells it to for large ships can use it power plants so a lot of like our early electricity plants would use it. And then if you have like a giant factory that you need to heat in the winter if you could use fuel oil for industrial heating as well. And so when i got to the section of the book i went pulled out my notes and highlights for the book on sam's murray which is called the fish state the world's episode two fifty five you haven't listened to it yet. The parallels between sam and leon are remarkable because they're both nineteen at this exact same time when they find what will turn out to be their life's greatest opportunity so i want to read some quotes here that sounds exactly like what's happening leon has this life sam spotted an opportunity where others saw nothing. The other fighters are literally throwing the trash is exactly what sam's murray did when he got when he started in the banana trade. He started with this thing these things called rights whether they would come into the port and they just throw them away cuz they're like hey these things you have to eat him in like the next two or three days we can't deliver to the end customer fast enough so let's just throw it away so there's a quote from. The fish at the well that describes this opportunity that was hiding in plain sight it says as far as he was concerned rights were considered trash only because boston fruit and other large firms were too slow footed to cover ground. It was a calculation based on arrogance i can be fast where others have been slow i can hustle where others have been satisfied with the easy pickings of the trade. I would say not only was a calculation based on arrogance but in both of leon's case and sam's murray's case it was a calculation based on desperation. They had no other option but to succeed where others had failed so five years later now we're nineteen thirty eight leon now has a fleet of about ten trucks. That are buying you know this this previously disposed fuel oil from other finers doing this light boiling this light refining and then. Transferring it and delivering it to other customers throughout the east coast he eventually buying so much of this fuel oil that is the by piece of land and purchases some second hand oil storage tanks. Any starts and oil storage terminal on this river in new jersey now keep in mind. Is one of the fascinating things about this part of the book leon's twenty four years old at this point and he's still living with his parents and his dad is now working for leon helping him in fact leon provides a job for his dad. All the way until his dad was in his nineties and so for the first few years of his oil business this is what his business consists of it says leon cut his teeth. Unresidual oil from refineries and built his business in the logistics around transporting oil to refineries as efficiently as possible and distributing the freshly produced fuel effectively now he is very unusual. Leon's very unusual for most of the oil barons that you might read about because essentially he works backwards. To the source a lot of people you know the right a ton of books about the people actually discovering right. He actually leon comes into the industry incrementally so he starts with the sale of the end product before working his way backwards into fuel storage refining and then finally oil exploration and actually discovery. So as a young leon has is trying to build his oil business world war two breaks out this winds up becoming excessively important because he's going to go to europe. Leon actually serves as the fuel supply officer for general patent this experience helps leon develop a talent for logistics and moving fuel efficiently. They create this thing called the red ball express the red box press was a vital ally logistics operation during world war two it was established to rapidly transport supplies. From normandy to advancing troops following the d-day invasion so. If you've ever studied general patent and i have a few books on them including his autobiography which i'll probably do an episode on eventually. His one of his main things was that he's just gonna move faster than everybody else he thought speed was one of the best weapons in fact he's got this great if you haven't listened to patent speech to the third army. It's one of the most famous speeches ever given i've listened to a bunch of times but there's a couple lines and kind of give you what was important to patent and so when he says when a man is lying in a shell hole if he just stays there all day a German will get to eventually. To hell with that my men don't dig foxholes foxholes only slow up an offensive keep moving later in the speech he says i don't want to get any messages saying i'm holding my position we're not holding a goddamn thing we're advancing constantly and patent wouldn't have been able to advance constantly you know who's a tanker without. This this the way to transport fuel rapidly and to follow him essentially as he just marches through France and the way that he was able to have uninterrupted supplies was the red ball express which. A young Leon Hess was working on so the red ball express was a marvel of logistics and helped ensure the Germans crumpled under the onslaught onslaught of a quick moving opposition to the Germans were still heavily reliant on moving things through by horses moving. Fuel and supplies by horses which blew my mind the red ball express lasted for 81 days in its 81 days it created a blueprint for how to move much needed supplies across the field of war at its peak 6000 trucks were in operation manned by 23,000 people including drivers and mechanics. Red ball trucks transported over 412 wow 412,000 tons of supplies in total in 81 days. So then we get to the part where post-war war two he comes back to America and he's going to have this massive explosion. In the size and success of his business and so anytime there's an idea I assume that you have portrait of the book portrait is on Mac if not I'd order immediately and I would go to the index of that book. And I would read about poor about Charlie mungers surfing model and so what what what monger does is. Essentially you can reverse engineer like why somebody would was successful and so in that book he there's a there's a few pages where. Munger is analyzing the outside success of less swap and monger says anytime you have extreme success it's usually you know this Lollapalooza effect it's these multiple factors working together to create these exceptional results and so he analyzes. What were the multiple factors that were contributing to less swap success he's like writing the Japanese tire wave he had this present brilliant incentive systems where he would share profits with. 50% of the profits with each of the employees who worked in each store he was a you know talented fanatic he was a gifted marketer and advertiser he had this very systematic approach. And how he executed and how he wanted all the stores operating and so over a few pages you know mongers just analyzing this for us and so I thought of this when I came back because there's I feel the same exact thing is happening in Leon has his life where there's. Leon's post world war two wave there's a series of events that were outside of his control that he surfed that first of all interactive with each other to produce a slalom lose effect but also he surfed magnificently so first of all. He comes home and he comes back to New Jersey and he's just like well I just got essentially world class education in logistics how to use trucks to mute to move fuel. That just so happens to be the best thing that could have happened to me considering that is my business okay so at this time again it goes back to he's still moving fuel oil this is that you know they has a consistency of molasses. The other oil man would call the bottom of the barrel because it was so heavy it was the heaviest of all the refined products okay. Why is that important and why at one point I think they said that I think the book says Leon has something like 80% of the market. Market share for fuel oil why because to move fuel oil successfully right you're required to move quickly and you have to have a mastery of logistics. Because if it's not kept at the right first was not delivered fast enough and it's not kept warm enough it will transform from liquid into like it cools and hardens. So the first part of Leon's post world war two wave is the fact that now he is maybe has maybe the most advanced logistics training for any of his competitors and he's able to transport this faster and more efficiently than anybody else. So number one he's just able to get the job done number two fuel oil. Is now going to have a massive increase in demand demand for fuel search to unprecedented levels as its use for power generation electricity plants used it. And in shipping expanded Hess called fuel oil the workhorse fuel of industrial America for its uses in utility boilers factory machinery and heating large buildings. Number three you have this massive explosion in demand of driving the industry grew to serve a burgeoning us middle class that wanted and needed to drive more and has metamorphosis. From a small dealer into one of the largest gasoline retailers on the east coast this is part of his constant march to go to the source memory starts a fuel delivery and storage and refineries and retail gas stations and then finally oil drilling and exploration number four. This is a massive increase this is wild to me the expansion of the industry that has operating in in forty five years okay so let's start the dawn of the twentieth century when Rockefeller was at his peak right production. What's a hundred and seventy four thousand barrels a day even at that size that can make Rockefeller part of the richest person on the planet right you fast forward forty five years. Where we are in the story where a young Leon Hess is building his own company the production is now four point six million barrels a day and then number five Leon starts building relationships and contacts which are going to lead to greater sources of capital so if you really think about what the Leon's post. Number one he's got the logistic expertise right person right set of skills right time number two the demand for fuel oil is exploding number three the US economy expands drastically. Increasing the purchasing power of the middle class and as a result demand for gasoline skyrockets number four America's insatiable appetite for all types of oil and then number five he finally unlocks relationships and capital including going public which i'll talk about a minute but. I need to talk about what one of maybe the most important relationship that he ever builds is this relationship with this guy named David Willis David is almost like such it's just it's gonna wind up being his father-in-law. But I would think of him as almost like the father that Leon chose so David. Is actually the attorney general of New Jersey and the book says that lands connection to David was critical in helping shape his success David become his friend his advisor ultimately his father-in-law. And help support Leon transformation from Cole Hall holler to oil Baron Leon met David before the war in fact while he was fighting in the war David oversaw Leon's business so he comes back. From the war his business has growing demand but he's in dire need of money and so actually David. Helps Leon build a relationship with chase manhattan bank that bank at the time is being run by David Rockefeller which is an interesting connection here and one of the most important traits for Leon was. Loyalty he expected loyalty and he gave it in return and so because. He says he gave all of his business to chase because of the effort they put into building the relationship with them he says they were the only ones who ever paid any attention to me. The rest of the banks never took me seriously David saw a lot of potential in Leon in fact David is the one introduced his daughter Norma to Leon they're going to be married for the rest of their lives. At the time where he does this Leon doesn't have a lot of money all the money is going back into the business so he actually has to borrow money to buy a suit for their first date. The contrast between their classes was obvious this is the daughter of the attorney general who had grown up with a great deal of privilege was in a different class from the owner of a fledgling fuel business. And yet David and Leon continue to share a deep connection until David died in 1988 and after David died someone else described David's view and relationship with Leon says David didn't mind rich people he liked them but the ones he really like started out poor like his son-in-law Leon whom he loved. And is also from David where Leon learned you have to balance work and family so says Hess was fully established as Leon's first child before he met Norma and he spent long evenings and weekends dedicated to the company's birth and early upbringing. But just as David had balanced a demanding career with dinner at home each evening Leon did the same sometimes having to return to the office for long hours at night after spending time with his wife and children so then Leon continues his march. To getting closer and closer to the actual source at this point he's buying and selling and storing fuels and Leon wasn't going to be content with just buying oil from refineries he's going to start his own refineries so he actually builds his first refinery in New Jersey in 1957. So now is result the company would no longer just be a middle man between refiners and customers it can now make its own product at its own facility and then he starts adding other refineries those one in texas. What eventually the reason i wanna read this party this entire section which this actually blew my mind because again speaks to the size and scope of his ambition. You start out as a 19 year old kid use truck i'm just gonna try to make my own way in this world. Now we're fast forward three decades later he was a building the largest refinery in the western hemisphere and he does so in the US Virgin Islands why why US Virgin Islands because US Virgin Islands hold a key advantage so the location that he chooses for this refinery. Allow Leon to take advantage of federal tax benefits this may be the only place in the world he can done this so the refineries able to secure foreign refiner status which allows it to circumvent federal rules. That required the use of higher cost US flag vessels when shipping oil to the east coast while simultaneously at the same time also receiving subsidies from the United States Department of Energy as a domestic refinery. There is a line i read in the biography the autobiography of trader Joe. The guy that started you know the grocery store and that i think about over and over again and he says as i learned time and time again success in business often rests on a minute reading of the regulations that impact your business. Exactly what Leon has to hear he picked the one place on the planet. We had this combination of unfair and i don't mean it's legal because it's completely legal of unfair advantages and i want to stack another unfair advantage on top of this or really on stacked another unfair advantage on the top of this. It was going to be a local monopoly there was only going to be one company allowed to build a refinery on the island Leon had to win this in fact there's a funny interview with the governor of the virgin islands. Talking about how he negotiate with how how Leon has negotiated says from the daily on has entered my office he did not leave the virgin islands until the deal was consummated. And then Leon also negotiated for another series of benefits so he also gets 16 years tax free in St. Croix partial government reimbursement for dredging a channel and free use of that channel for 16 years. Now this this minute reading of regulations it's not like this is a one off this is not something that Leon did one time he found another loophole and another like regulatory advantage. Leon figured out ways to make laws work to his advantage in one instance he found that oil would not be considered an import and thus therefore taxed right as one if he bought it from St. Lucia to St. Croix by bars so he took apart his large ships had the engine propulsion cut in two and the bulkheads wielded welded on each side and then pin them back together the pins were huge so technically the drive portion could be disconnected from the cargo portion. Well it may not appear so to the untrained I legally these boats qualified as barges so the massive quantities of oil they carried were exempted from the taxes that would otherwise be levied. So now he has the largest refinery in the western hemisphere it's perfectly located because he's able to refine oil coming from the middle east and south america here finds it in the US Virgin Islands and then ships that fuel to customers on the east coast of america now there is an idea in here where. If you're looking to do something in your business I bet you if you study. Other industries are other companies in your same industry they attempted something in the past that was similar and yet forgotten he's building in this and I think nineteen sixties he wasn't the first to look in the Caribbean he wasn't the first oil baron to build a refinery in the Caribbean shell built one in nineteen eighteen in Curacao and standard oil had built a refinery in Aruba in nineteen twenty nine. And so there's only stories in the book about how important this one refinery was for his business and you see this with his actions the refinery is incredibly important to Leon so he would fly in every Friday to inspect his refinery to review its operations finances and crude state. Across the refining industry stories of Leon's persistence at the plant became legend Leon would show up and check units at two a.m. to make sure they were running properly. At the same time he's building his refinery he's also starting to expand into gas stations he will open his first gas station in nineteen sixty in New Jersey by the end of the decade he had gas stations in sixteen states there was an interesting line here that I didn't realize he purposely did the opposite and simplified. What his gas station did compared to the existing competitors unlike his competitors the has station attendance didn't change your oil they didn't carry batteries tires or windshield wipers or have car mechanics on site and for a long time they wouldn't even take credit cards because Leon felt that slowed the refueling process down. And so two separate times has merges with another company this is very important so the first time it reads to me that he merges with this company just to take has public so in nineteen sixty two has merges with this company called clear track corporation. They used to be a Cleveland based farm equipment maker okay but they just sold off most of its equipment business the year before so I'm not at all. It's not obvious like what the company's actually doing but this is what the book says what Leon was getting with the purchase was a seat on the New York Stock Exchange has would finally become a publicly traded company and becoming a public company open new sources of financing to Leon. Six years later there's this oil exploration company. I called a marida the name comes from combining America and Canada together so in December nineteen sixty eight has merges with a marida this is by far the biggest deal and has his history so it takes you know company that originated as the small time distributor of residual oil. Now with the combination of America's business looks like a miniature version of Exxon so the deal makes has into a vertically integrated energy company with its hands and every single stage of oil's journey from discovery to gas tank. Leon had joined the board eleven months before the merger was announced. To get that seat he had to make a massive investment so has made a big investment two years earlier they spent a hundred million dollars to buy nine point seven percent stake in the company. And so this is another example of Leon getting closer to the source to the actual discovery of oil right and having more control for his business because after he drastically expands his refining capability which I just told you about he's buying having to buy more and more oil in fact he is shells. Biggest single customer and one thing that Leon was worried about he's like he didn't want his company to be held captive to producers anymore and the reason that the combination of has an America was actually interesting. So has was an oil refining and marketing company with no significant production facilities and a marida was an oil producing company with no refining or marketing facilities at all look how close they were to. Like the each other's production so the year of the merger in nineteen sixty eight has was refining an average of a quarter million barrels of crude oil a day. And a marida is producing about two hundred and ninety thousand barrels a day and there's a lot of stories of just how wild the oil businesses in the book there's a great line says that will businesses not all beer and skittles. I was on my back last week I had bronchitis I was like super six for almost a week. And so I went up watching a bunch of things that I normally wouldn't have time to do and actually binge watched the first season of this this show called land man which I thought was actually pretty good. And there's a great line in land man where he said you know it's a it's a show about the oil business in Texas and there's a great line from you know the billionaire. Head of the oil company that one of the main characters in land man he says describing the oil business which I thought was great he says our business is a constant state of crisis interrupted by periods of immense success. I thought it was a great way to put it one of the craziest stories in the book is Leon's talking about you know he's going all over the world. To source more oil and in some cases you know these are these are dictators and so he's actually having to negotiate with like a representative of Gaddafi in Libya. And right in the middle of a negotiation the guy just pulls out a gun and puts his pistol on the tape on the table between them. I guess it's some kind of like bargaining chip or just saying hey realize who you're dealing with here. But there's one thing that I admire about Leon was he's he's got it he's got a bit of like an old school east coast like gangster to him and I don't mean that as pejorative. I mean like he believed in like a handshake handshake agreement between gentlemen he thought it was your duty to keep your mouth shut he would talk about don't write anything down. Even when he was like bribing people he did it in an honorable way so he writes up. A letter to shareholders remember this a publicly traded company and he has the right letter to shareholders because the regulations in the oil industry are changing so I just want to read some excerpts from this letter to the shareholders. He goes in the hope of obtaining a benefit for our corporation I made a series of payments substantial in the aggregate to a foreign government official. The bribery was unsuccessful he told shareholders the payments were made in the hope of promoting a project which never materialized and the company received nothing as a result of the payments. The bribery money was his it did not come from the company's coffers and had and he hadn't sought any reimbursement and no deductions were taken from the payment. So again even when he's even when he's bribing you know he's doing it in an honorable way it's like I did with my own money and didn't do it like I didn't ask to be it didn't come from the company I didn't ask for any reimbursements but the reason he brought this up. Is because less than a year later the payments that Leon was writing about would be illegal because Congress enacted a new source of regulation and it's called the foreign corrupt practices act to make overseas bribery and political contributions a crime. In the United States there's actually a pretty funny line in the book that came right after this you know it kind of talked about. It said she says a practice as old as cross border trade itself was now under scrutiny. I think it just speaks to how wild the oil businesses like he you know he's he in some cases he's negotiating with people and they're like. The essentially one family runs the entire country it's like okay yeah it's not just oh you can buy our oil and here's the money it's like here's the price for oil by the way you have to use this company and Mike Mike cousin happens around that company and you have to use. If you need to build roads then you have to use this road construction company oh yeah that happens to be my brother-in-law he's just there's just just a wild life. And industry that this guy that Leon you know built this massive company him but I did think it was very fascinating that even though the company was publicly traded like he really ran it ran it like a family business. And one of the things I most admired about Leon was how close he was to not only his son but his entire his entire family you ran essentially this is like a family venture for 80 years it just happened to be. I think it was like the 14th most valuable oil company in the world and I think this really speaks to us where his son John who takes over as a CEO role after Leon does. At John's wedding you know Leon was the best man and so the book talks about the family business at length it says the Hess's were a close knit family they spent time together not out of obligation. But out of general affinity and they were fiercely loyal to one another for Leon his life's ventures were centered on the family so there's a bunch of interviews. And quotes from his daughters says he was an extraordinary father and role model this is his daughter Marlene has his standards for himself and our family were high he couldn't tolerate deadbeats or liars he was a man of his word so we had to be too. He expected the best of himself and also all of us he worked hard and so did we he cared deeply for his fellow man and instilled that in us to his other daughter Constance. Made a list of other lessons that she remembered from her father this is after he her father passed away treasure a good name treasure good name something he repeat over and over again hold your cards close to your chest. Love is unconditional and this is this is really funny if you have to talk to the press make sure that you're not the story. And so as a young girl in the 1950s his daughter Marlene said she would remember wearing her pajamas and her slippers and returning to Leon's office with him after dinner so at this time the company's headquarters were still a set of trailers. This part actually reminded me of Walt Disney I read the 700 page biography of Walt Disney multiple times and there's a great excerpt from that biography about Walt Disney and the way he was with his daughters that remind me of the way Leon Hess was with his daughters. Says Walt Disney would chase the girls around the house cackling like the witch from Snow White or he would troll them endlessly by their heels for hours and hours Diane would say that's one of Walt's daughters or he would stand in the swimming pool and let them climb onto his shoulders. I thought that my father was the strongest man in the world and the most fun Dan recalled at night he would read to them and on the weekends he would take them either to Griffin Park or to ride the merry-go-round or to the studio. Where they would follow him as he snooped about and peddled their bikes around the empty grounds why he worked. This is what Walt said they used to go they used to love to go with me in those days and that was some of the happiest days of my life they were in love with their dad. If you did not listen to that episode is episode 346 is called how Walt Disney built himself it's one of the most incredible books you can read about one of the most incredible entrepreneurs to ever live. Outside of the office Leon was there for his children while still running an increasingly major company. During the summer his son would participate in swim meets he would arrive just in time to see John swim and they get back into his car where driver was waiting to whisk him away back to the office. Something that the Hess family had in common with a lot of the people you and I've been discussing the past few weeks if you look at the Wallenbergs are heady green. They train them in business both the green family the Wallenberg family and now the Hess's at a very very young age is really smart something I say lauders family did something the Walton family did this just this idea which reappears over again. Says the whole Hess's social life largely spun around Leon's growing business network as they entertain bankers and colleagues at home indoctrinating their children especially John. In the corporations culture and preparing John to run the rapidly expanding business from the age of seven John was being groomed to take over Hess. John spent time in the trenches is just like the Wallenbergs and the greens again. John spent time in the trenches learning the business by pumping gas at a station in Jersey doing accounting for a refinery are taking part in operations in St. Croix in the oil fields in Oklahoma in college John studied Arabic and Farsi preparing for a career leading a multinational oil company after getting his undergraduate degree at Harvard. John attended business school striking up connections that help him guide the company Leon would tell his son and his daughters treasure a good name he wanted the Hess name to be recognized and respected. And so throughout the book his kids are talking about the way he ran his company people working inside of the company for multiple decades talked about this so I made a list of really just things that reappear over again. Leon was extremely focused on details and appearances details detail details over and over again he was obsessed with the details of delivery at budget meetings he would quiz the head of the company's trucking division on the amount of life left in the tires. There's several quotes throughout the book on the importance of cleanliness he was obsessed with things being clean says the first thing I look at an oil tanker is the engine room bilge clean bilges denote good housekeeping he said that in 1987 memory sources company in 1933 he dies in 1999 he was obsessed with cleanliness in 1933. He was still obsessed with cleanliness in 1987 right from the start he made sure his trucks were kept clean and employees learned that working at a house facility meant painting and repainting to make everything look like new. Whether it was a huge storage tank or the white curb at the house gas stations again the importance of cleanliness and order is repeated Leon realized early on. That had been the cleanest safest seeming gas stations was not only aesthetically pleasing it could also provide a business advantage as the family car and car trips are becoming more prevalent has would be the easy choice for those looking for quick service and clean bathrooms. Giving him a potential leg up on rivals who did not pitch put as much emphasis on appearances as a manager Leon had been described as tough but fair he had an exacting eye for detail. But he imposed the same standards on himself as he did on others work hard know everything you could about your business and if you made a mistake learn from it and move on. Leon he is often described as fatherly and no one at either the Hess company or the New York Jets he owns the New York Jets for like three decades which I'll get to in a minute. Wanted to disappoint him this is something his players talked about people in the coaches staff people with the executives and even people working in refineries for has talked about the they did not. They admired him so much they worked hard and they didn't want to disappoint him he wasn't prone to emotional outbursts he came from a school in which a handshake was sufficient for a deal. Leon was a gambler at heart he wasn't afraid of risk Leon ran his company with the ambition of a major oil company combined with the mindset of a startup and one thing that he would do. He felt the fact that he was always on the road he was he was a tireless traveler. That he was able to seek out opportunity where other larger and oil companies were kind of a little lazier and they want opportunities to come to him. I come to them Leon traveled a lot for his job and encourage those who work for him to travel as well to find new opportunities as an entrepreneur Leon had the opposite mindset. As some of the major oil companies that let opportunities find them he was always hungry for new prospects he was never averse to taking risks he loved negotiating he was unpredictable and he used that unpredictability to his advantage. He would take a lot of trouble to get to know his counterparties and their families he built very strong relationships he had great connections all over the world is very similar to the wallenberg's if you listen to the last episode I just did. Leon knew each employee by name he put effort to know everyone he worked with he even knew the name of the guy who fixed the air conditioning and his office. He had both an exacting attention to detail on the type of outgoing engaging personality that made him stop executives and industry acquaintances. Who were too eager to get into business talk at the start of a phone call instead he wanted to hear about their wives their children and their lives outside of the office this is something that's repeated over and over again in the book this was the type of family owned business touch that Leon favored. He also ran a more efficient business and his competitors one competitor told how Leon showed them how to do more with less he ran a facility with 400 people. Where other companies would have used twice as many workers there's a great line in the book how to make a few billion dollars by brad jacobs that it covered all the way up on episode 335. About this he says brad wrote I find that slightly understaffed teams are more focused and spend less time doing redundant busy work be deliberately understaffed is a really interesting idea the personal attention that Leon showed to his employees something is repeated over and over again as well. Every night this is one of the refineries every night he'd make a point of sitting down and eating dinner with the guys he would walk around the room and shake everybody's hand. That kind of recognition brought loyalty for many employees many of whom would describe themselves as being very devoted to him back to Leon's impressive attention to detail he could recite the margin of every gasoline station on the east coast. So she spent seven hours over two days with John Mackey the founder of whole foods John Mackey can do the exact same thing he could pass a whole foods and he could tell you what the revenue number was. What their operating income was what their margins were hit this like encyclopedic knowledge of the financial performance and all the numbers of all the whole foods and sounds exactly what what Leon has had in his head for all of his gas stations. Leon has would also do things that other competitors were not doing I remember this when I was a kid. It was Leon's idea so you remember the Hest toy trucks actually had these toy trucks when I was a kid and the idea to make them actually emerge from a conversation and Leon had with a friend who was also a toy manufacturer at a football game in the 1960s so. The idea initially was to create models of all the working Hest vehicles and what I found most fascinating is Leon was personally involved again goes speaks to his attention to detail. Leon was personally involved in designing each toy so these toy trucks start out as a idea the idea the original idea was like these are great marketing tools and they wind up becoming collectors items. The people to this day stand they they still collect them and some of the prices are incredible I would have to imagine that took Leon by surprise I'm sure he didn't think I'm going to make a marketing tool I'm going to start I'm an oil company manufacturing. Toys and going to be coming a collector's item and you know something that people cherish and reminds them of you know the holiday season decades later another thing. That I know for a fact had taken by surprise is how successful his investment in the in the New York Jets was so Leon actually acquires a 20% stake in the New York Jets you when we call the New York Jets app. In 1963 for which he paid $250,000 and he said I was one of five partners the name of the team at the time was the New York Titans they were in bankruptcy and we changed the name to New York Jets. Before the purchase the Titans were the worst manage most unprofessional professional team of the modern era there were bounce checks player strikes coach shuffling questionable player choices it was hardly a sure investment. So as the years pass Leon slowly over many years buys out the four other owners and eventually becomes the sole owner. This again speaks to how important family was the Leon has says for a man who didn't have hobbies Sunday football was something you could share with his family there's a hilarious. Story I really think speaks to Leon's personality as well the famous coach bill parcels tells a story of calling Leon one day to inform him of yet another expensive player contract. I don't give a shit Leon told him if you run out of money come over here to the oil company will get you some more money this afternoon. So Leon actually owns the team until he dies in 1999 now this might surprise you he insisted that the Jets be sold after he died the speculation is that he insisted on this because he did not want his family to be distracted from running the oil company. Says Leon insisted that no member of the Hess family would be part of the purchasing syndicate in any way any family member that did try to own a part of the team after his death would lose a third of their inheritance. Woody Johnson of the Johnson Johnson family fortune bought the team for 635 million dollars in 1999 the Jets sold for almost as much as Leon's personal stake in Hess was worth at the time or about 10 times less. Than what the Jets would reportedly sell for today as for the Hess Corporation 90 years after Leon Hess starts in his own words a little oil company with just one used truck when he was just 19 years old Chevron announced that it would acquire Hess in an all stock deal for 53 billion dollars. And that is where I'll leave it for the full story highly recommend buying a book if you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes your podcast player are available founders podcast.com you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time that is 378 books down 1000 ago and I'll talk to you again soon. Okay so I want to give you a big update to founders notes so I'm eight years into this podcast at the end of the year I will have read over 400 pie graphies and what I'm trying to do is I want to organize and distill the collective knowledge of history's greatest founders and I want to do that better than anybody else on the planet which is why I work on the podcast seven days a week so. As you can imagine you know 360 380 pie graphies read whatever Matt right now it's nearly impossible for me to remember call everything that I've read so I built a tool that allows me to tap into the ideas from history's greatest founders on demand when I need it so I use this tool every day. I told you about in the past for the past year it's called founders notes you can subscribe and access the tool that I built and I use what you see is the exact version that I use I don't have a different version literally the tool you can subscribe to is the one I use every day. So the update that I have for you is I've been working with the team at read wise which is the company and the founders that have helped me build this tool and so for the past few months we've been working on a major redesign for founders notes that redesign is done it's available now the pre history of this. Is that for the first six years of the podcast I've been using this app that called read wise to store all my notes and highlights for every book that I read for the podcast right allows us to like giant database I could search it and pull up information there anytime I need it so I partnered with read wise over a year ago because a bunch of people listen to the podcast say hey I'd love to be able to access and read all of your notes and highlights so we build this tool called founders notes that allows you to do that you can still do that you can still read all my notes my highlights and I keep adding to them every week and will always do so because I can't make it easier to read. I can't make the podcast without this tool but over time we started adding other features and what I realized is the AI assistant that we called sage that sits inside of founders notes is the most valuable feature by far so a few weeks ago if you listen to the episode I did with on Jensen Wong in that book Jensen says that in the future and right now really people have a virtual assistant almost like a brilliant intern with near perfect memory capable of instantly recalling any piece of knowledge stored on any computer and when I got to that section the note I left myself was that sage is going to be this but for the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs so when I asked sage a question it reads all of my notes all of my highlights all of my transcribes transcripts and provides a concise summary and answer to the information I'm looking for and the reason I would heavily recommend that you subscribe and get access to this is because I think you should be using sage to supplement the decisions that you make in your work so it is spooky how when I asked sage a question it sounds like me except with a much better memory and so another cool thing that we added is when you log in you can see all these like suggested questions things that you could ask sage all of those suggested questions are things that I have asked sage and so now as I'm continuing to ask more to use to use it to ask more to prompt sage more I continually to add add to this suggested prompts suggested questions list so even when you don't have a question of your own you can actually read and learn from what I'm asking sage so the way I would use the tool of the primary value is I think any question you have in your business you should be asking sage because what happens is becomes like you can prompt all of history's greatest entrepreneurs to help solve the problem or to supplement your own thinking that you're dealing with inside of your business so if you have not already subscribed to founders notes I heavily recommend doing so if you want to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand and use this as a supplement to the decisions that you're making in your work highly recommend you go to foundersnotes.com that is founderswithaness just like the podcast foundersnotes.com and sign up today thank you very much for the extra support thank you for listening and I'll talk to you again soon.
