And how is friend would even pay attention to how much is business was spending on bottled water.

Since I study dead entrepreneurs for a living I get the question like out of the living entrepreneurs who do you most admire and a lot of the people on the list would be familiar to you but I found when I mentioned that one of the living entrepreneurs that I most admire is this guy named Todd Graves people first of all haven't heard of them and they're even more surprised when I said well Todd Graves founded this quick service restaurant that serves only chicken fingers over 30 years ago he owns over 90% of it and the business his business is called the business is worth at least 10 billion dollars and I think Todd is a great example of one of my favorite ideas I heard from Charlie Munger of find a simple idea and take it seriously and so I didn't know who Todd Graves was because there's no books written about him. I saw a clip a few years ago and I watched every interview I could find with them and so for this episode what I did is there's two main interviews that he gave I transcribed them and then I went through the transcripts just like I do for the books but there is my fascination with this person is sometimes you can find you hear somebody say express an idea or perspective or philosophy they could be like in a sentence or two and you're immediately like yes I feel that way too this happened with Pat Riley you know the legendary coach and NBA executive and I was listening to an interview with him many years ago and he was asked why is winning insatiable you know Pat is in his seventies and he's still pushing it every day he's still working very hard he's still determined to win and he said I hated to lose I always thought that there'd be severe consequences if I lost it was personal to me when a pause there remember that line it was personal to me Todd's gonna repeat that over and over and over again I like how serious he takes it. He takes his business I feel the same way just like I feel exactly identify exactly with the way Todd is building raising canes with the way that Pat Riley's still approaching his career you know five decades into it and then he can and then the follow up question in this interview with Pat Riley was but how could you feel that way and as soon as I heard this this is how I know I'm eventually gonna do an episode on Pat to cause like I felt I feel this way too he goes I just did I felt that way since the day I came out of my mother's womb I felt. That I wasn't going to let anybody take anything from me that I worked hard to get you're gonna see a lot of similarities between that short excerpt from an interview Pat Riley for the what we're gonna go through it Todd Graves I'm gonna start I'm gonna go kind of in order Todd's career but I do want to start with the one clip that I saw that made that peak my interest as soon as I heard that I sat up I said wait wait wait I've seen this before once Todd has a lot in common as we'll see with a lot of history's greatest founders but also you see this idea over and over again where you can have a lot of success. Charlie Munger is this great line something to the effect of oftentimes in the winning we find the winning system in business goes ridiculously far minimizing and or maximizing one or a few variables and he used Costco as an example and so the clip that I saw was Todd saying you know he has this very simple menu the same menu that he's had since day one he had all these people tell him before he started the business in the early years of the business to this day what you're doing is not gonna work your menu is too simple you need to follow the trend you need to do what your competitors are doing and he's just so stubbornly believes in doing one thing and doing it the best you can so he says I've always believed in doing one thing and doing it better than anybody else if you do what you do well and consistently do a great your customers will come back and so if I added different things meaning to the menu if I over complicated things if I made things he believes in this like this beautiful simplicity I identify with so if I add different things I wouldn't be as quick in the drive-thru if I added all these things my quality would go down my speed would go down and it wouldn't be our concept add adding different things and losing focus would lose while we're special and so it's not just hey if I narrow the focus if I limit the amount of details that my business has and then perfect every single detail I will create the greatest product in my category which he's obviously done but it's also he understands how everything he does relates to the entire system so this idea is like well if I have a more simple menu one that makes my product better because I can really focus on that right but it means that people come through the drive-thru or come into the store and because there are four things you go into racing canes right you like do you want three chicken fingers do you want four or do you want six it makes you can order faster and so why is that important may not make a difference when you have one or two stores if you save 1530 seconds for each order but it makes a hell of a difference right when you have 800 stores like he does today and so he continues this and I didn't see this that's where the clip ended and then he continues adding to this he goes so we even try to limit distracting things in the drive-thru so he does a lot of like charity work there's a lot of celebrities he has like reason canes has a cult like following it's very much like in and out and I'm gonna draw the analogy of in and out over and over again today because it's just like oh this is like Harry Snyder the founder of in and out in and out is reincarnated and his name is Todd Graves and so there's this the show that he was doing that was helping restaurants with Snoop Dogg and so he's like oh let's let's advertise the show we'll put on drive-thru so there's a picture of me and Snoop Dogg he's like wait a minute that the problem was even putting that poster people sit there for like an extra five or ten seconds and look at this and he's like wait we got to rethink this because we got 20 cars behind that guy that is sitting there taking an extra 10 or 15 seconds and delaying his order because he's looking at this picture of Snoop Dogg that actually is not serving my goal which is to get the best food the highest quality meals unbelievably fast there's a couple things that immediately you know popped my mind because anytime I'm reading about anybody as you already know it's like I'm not thinking about just what Todd Graves is telling us or what he's trying to teach you and I I'm thinking is like who else who how who else does this relate to and so this is great exchange that happens in this biography of Rockefeller called Titan which is the most famous biography of Rockefeller right and it's a perfect example of this and so Rockefeller was obsessed with with the efficiency of every single aspect of his business just like Todd Graves is and so he's going walking around at this refinery and he's seeing that one of his employees they're soldering the like closing these cans of one of the byproducts that that they're they're they're selling from refining oil and so he goes up to him Rockefeller goes up because hey how many drops of solder do you use on each can and the guy says 40 and Rockefeller goes have you ever tried 38 and the guy said no he goes would you mind having some sealed with 38 and let me know when 38 drops were applied a small percentage of cans leaked so they try again they try 39 at 39 drops of solder none link hence 39 drops of solder became the new standard instituted at all standard oil refineries now this is what Rockefeller Rockefeller smiling he's talking about this in his retirement he's telling a story after he retired that one drop of solder saved $2,500 in the first year but the export business kept on increasing after that and doubled and quadrupled and became immensely greater than it was and that savings has gone steadily along one drop on each can and has amounted since to many hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings I feel the same way about Todd grace if he's clipping 1530 seconds off of each order when he has one store that's you know not as important but it's very important think about the time saved when he has 800 stores this guy's gonna have thousands of stores I do the same thing so I'm one of the very few podcasters because I go out and talk to all these other podcasters that still insist on editing his own podcast and you I believe the idea and the reason I think is important because I'm completely obsessed about save not with not wasting a second of your time so I will go back through and I will literally clip a second and people think this is a bit ridiculous my point is like let's say a million people listen to that episode over the life of that episode okay I didn't that means I didn't take out a second I did the math the other day I think it's like I took for every second I am able to cut that's a waste of time I say 244 hours it's the same exact thinking that Todd graves is applying to the speed of a strife through that Rockefeller is applying to how many drops of solder on an individual can and one of the like a thousand byproducts that he was selling and then the second thing that came to my mind when he talks about you know this isn't our concept I just gonna do one thing I'm gonna do a great I'm gonna do that that same thing forever and the guys had the same menu for 30 years if you go look at in and outs menu it's barely changed and it was found in like 1948 and so I think of what David Olguby said because he noticed this not the people they're so it's cut it's in human nature to like constantly want to jump around and be distracted and David Olguby's case he's watching all of these businesses have like these great ads that they pull and so he noticed he's like the people had the most success is they'd find a winning promise for their product right and they would run that same ad and build ads around the same promise for decades and this is what David Olguby said about this which I feel you know David died he didn't know what raising gains was but I feel like he would describe exactly what Todd is doing with his business this is what David Olguby said what guts it takes what obstinate determination to stick to one coherent creative policy year after year in the face of all the pressure to come up with something new every six months that is David Olguby talking about a winning idea could work for decades so that's what really drew my attention to him I've been studying this guy for a few years and I realized the reason I needed this episode for you because the comes up in conversation like every week and I was like now I just want to be like hey you want to know what this guy's about go listen to you know episode 383 or whatever episode number that's going to be so I'm going to go through I organized all my notes and highlights and I try to put in a chronological order as much as I can so he's going to talk about the fact that this early experience he had before he started raising canes he says I grew up working in restaurants and bars in high school and college and before that I was the kid that did the lemonade stand in the neighborhood I was always entrepreneurial another thing that I identify and I love about Todd great he loves founders he talks about over and over again we need more founders stop selling your goddamn business we need more founders to retain control of their business and to actually give a damn about what they're doing I absolutely love this he says raising canes was a college business plan and so for business planning class me and my partner wrote a paper and they wrote a paper about starting a quick service restaurant that only sells chicken fingers and he was doing this at LSU the first raising canes is actually opened around I think the northern gates of LSU writes the paper what happens we get the worst grade in the class okay we've seen this over and over again it's amazing there is a rather big indictment right where you get a bad grade for this idea that winds up being worth you know 10 10 billion dollars was not the first time we saw this Fred Smith I don't know how much FedEx is worth today but it's a lot right he writes a paper that he's going to start FedEx he wrote the paper in college his business professor gave him a C Phil Knight founder of Nike same thing he talks about this in his great autobiography and shoe dog he says being a business buff I knew that Japanese cameras had made deep cuts into the camera market which had once been dominated by the Germans at the time that that Phil Knight starts Nike the Germans are dominating running shoes so he takes that idea that one idea that happened in another industry so I wonder if that will work in this industry so I argued in this paper that I made the Japanese running shoes might do the same thing that idea interested me and it inspired me and then it captivated me it seems so obvious to me so simple so potentially huge and so he gives this presentation he talks about they greeted my passion and intensity with labored sighs and vacant stairs so again I'm great and Keynes FedEx Nike I would not be discouraged at all if you're telling people other people are you're writing your own business school and you're writing papers about this this business you want to start people like this sucks this idea is terrible just like well that's what they said to Todd Graves they said it to Fred Smith and they said to Phil Knight and they were wrong now this is what I also absolutely love about Todd Graves is everybody's stupid idea and he goes if you tell me I can't do something his immediate reaction is let me show you I'm going to do it and so he took he hinted there the fact that when he started raising Keynes he had a co-founder he had a partner and this partner is going to actually leave after the second store and that's one thing that Todd repeats a bunch the fact that you know he's just you should set up your business to actually the activity of your business you actually love to do the co-founder did not love the business like Todd he did not have a chicken finger dream this is again I think some people would even think you know this is a bit ridiculous you're saying you're living a chicken finger dream this guy's completely obsessed with chicken fingers it's not ridiculous to me because it makes I see it over and over and over again because I went through this like when I said I want to sort of podcast on the books I read you know I had some of my closest friends saying this is stupid this idea like no one's gonna listen this isn't gonna work and so the partner sells out after a second one okay and Todd explains this it makes perfect sense to Todd why his partner quit and he didn't he goes he wasn't a fry cook cashier so to this day that's the way Todd describes himself he says his business card says founder CEO fry cook cashier he likes working drive-thrus he likes making chicken fingers he likes working the fry line he goes it didn't make my partner happy but I love working drive-thrus I like working fry lines it's what I love which is important I tell all these young entrepreneurs I tell these students now whatever you get into make sure it's something you like to do make sure it's something you're passionate about because if not you won't be successful at it work comes down to a grind but if you love it then you'll always be happy doing it and more importantly what he doesn't say but is implied you'll do it for a long time okay so raising canes is growing faster now 30 years into the business than it has ever grown before and I've seen this over and over again because it's in all these biographies over and over again in fact there's a great line in Peter Thiel's book zero to one where he talks about this and he mentioned this phenomenon the fact that you know you can if concepts working they actually will grow faster many decades into the future than it will at the beginning which is surprising to a lot of people Peter mentions this that you know with respect to technology companies but I've seen it in all kinds of businesses and so Peter said the vast majority of tech companies value will come from profits it will generate in the future 10 20 or 30 years out that is also true with raising canes and that's why I again I think the implication there's like if you'd love to do it like you're never going to stop doing it therefore you'll never interrupt the compounding Steve Jobs had a great line about this he says you know people say you have a lot of passion for what you're doing and it's totally true and the reason is because it's so hard that if you don't love it any rational person would give up because they're saying that is exactly what Todd graves expressed the exact same opinion of Steve Jobs in this interview and this is something that Todd repeats over and over again that giving up was never an option selling was never an option this guy has turned down billions and billions of dollars and says later on that he never even thought about taking the money for a second so I want to get into he writes this this paper okay so how do you go from writing the paper to getting the money he's a 23 year old kid when he has this this idea it's like I'm actually going to do this for real this is really important because you're going to see a lot of parallels between him and Harry Snyder which I'll get to the founder of in and out so he's like okay I need money to open up my first spot I thought you know I was I was turning into a businessman so I go in and buy some cheap suit I go to Office Depot I buy a briefcase okay I brought the business plan that I got a bad grade on in the briefcase and I come down and I talked to these bankers because I'm going to get it obviously I'm going to get a loan about this chicken finger dream I had he repeats that line over and over again I'm living a chicken finger dream says the banks were nice enough but every one of them was like hey man you might want to work in the industry for 10 years you might want to do this you might want to do that you're not in a position for us to lend you money once again I'm hearing no no no and that made me want to do it even more and so what one thing that Todd is to share is in common with a lot of the great founders that you and I studies like they know their their business from A to Z they know their business cold and he was telling them listen I knew how much I knew down to how much like each apron was going to cost me I had done my research and the promise he had all these people saying that he hadn't done his research because you just came up with a chicken finger only concept and they said you didn't do your research because McDonald's is adding all this variety and all these different things and you're doing the opposite but I knew doing one thing and doing it better than anybody else would always pay off and so it might be a little ridiculous but I was kind of induced into a state of rage when I'm hearing this because first of all I hate other people going around telling young entrepreneurs that your idea won't work like you don't know you have no idea how the hell could you even think that you would be able to predict what would work right but they're like oh you know you didn't do your research obviously you don't know anything about this industry you're gonna want to work in we're not gonna lend you money because look what McDonald's is doing okay so there's a there's a historical equivalent at the time that Todd Graves is trying to raise money for raising games there's already historical equivalent on the West Coast dominating creating a cult like following the exact approach that that Todd Graves was using is the one that Harry Snyder started back in the 40s with in and out so I pulled all this I have an AI system that reads all of my notes highlights and transcripts and I use it constantly to like remind myself of the stuff you know that we're learning on this podcast because I'm eight years in I'm gonna be like 400 biographies written or read by the end of the year like it's possible to remember all this and so I just pulled I was like give me all the best ideas from Harry Snyder in and out because I know I've seen this before and so I'm just gonna pull out some chunks that I'm reading to you about Harry Snyder this is not about Harry Snyder it is about Todd Graves and implied in that it could also be about me and you and so it says while other chains constantly expanded their menus Harry maintained a famously limited menu this menu has been barely changed since the company's founding in 1948 that is exactly that this sounds like Todd Graves Harry was fanatical about quality Todd is the same way refusing to follow industry trends is exactly what the bankers are getting wrong they didn't even understand that Todd was right and you could just point in and out it's like well I don't know this guy did the same thing why would not work Harry was fanatical about quality refusing to follow industry trends towards cheaper ingredients and mass production techniques when competitors switched to frozen beef patties right that the trend in Harry's industry Harry hired in and outs first butcher to maintain control over product quality while other chains adopted frozen french fries in and out continued making theirs by hand from fresh potatoes that were often picked in the morning and delivered in the same evening Harry's leadership was hands-on to the extreme degree dude I'm like tears my sorry later on because I hear the same thing remember this later on when when when Todd everybody tells him he's like you need to delegate and Todd is one of my favorite parts of any interviews I've ever done it goes delegate what kind of word is that he is so obsessed with details I feel the same way so says Harry's leadership was hands-on to an extreme degree he was described as a micromanager before the term existed keeping scrupulous records of daily operation his work ethic was relentless every single one of these lines I went through and made sure that if I'm talking about Harry Snyder that it's also true for Todd Graves he was always the first person in the shop in the morning inspecting ingredients and ensuring everything ran to his exacting specifications even when at home he would watch the restaurant through his living room window and sprint across the street to pitch in when needed Todd lived in an apartment behind the first raising canes Harry also believed in treating employees well this is something Todd's gonna repeat over and over again we're meeting you're gonna talk about this bunch today when California's minimum wage was 65 cents an hour Harry paid a dollar an hour plus a free hamburger per shift this approach fostered remarkable loyalty many employees who started as potato peelers stayed at the company for decades is pretty incredible all of this sounds exactly like Todd Graves approach to building raising canes again you want to learn more about Harry Snyder it's the episode is up to 244 to my favorite stories because again it's like find a simple idea and take it very seriously so this is where I get it you know this would kind of maybe upset you know I'm glad I don't think you can stop Todd Todd is like the Terminator anyways guys you know has superhuman levels of determination this just like arrogance of these like older bankers telling this kid like oh yeah you know obviously you're like it can't work because McDonald's isn't doing this I just really pisses me off and so good thing is Todd talks about he's like you know he was born determined he's like that determination was always there determination he always had it was there since he was a kid and he says and it really paid off later in a big way when I wanted to start this dream so think about where we are in the story People tell them your plan sucks we're not gonna lend you money your menu is wrong and then shortly after you know he gets going his co-founder quits on him so he's a guy they're not gonna let me money I'm on a dream I'm determined how am I gonna raise money so he hears the job about two different jobs the first job is a boiler maker and so these refineries will pay you insane amount of money because let's say one of the refineries go down they need maintenance work repair work they need that back every day that that refinery set up you know the losing a ton of money so these boilermakers go and they travel around. And these do shift work and he says you know you're working ninety five hours a week you work for five or six weeks straight but you make so much money because they want that job done fast. And he's around like a bunch of roughnecks you know imagine who are boilermakers and his they they notice his work ethic he was he wouldn't shut up about the chicken finger dream. And so his fellow boilermakers getting wild bill told him he's like hey in the summer you can make money commercial fishing in Alaskan so like you know right decade and a half ago I used to. I watched a few episodes of the show called. I think it's called deadly is catch so I didn't know that this is what Todd Graves was doing. And so they're like go up to Alaska and you know you work on a boat for thirty days for sixty days you can just make twenty five or fifty thousand dollars. And there's also a funny thing that you know he never raised outside equity after this and some of the boilermakers like wild bill one of the few like angel investors that would put in money to raising canes and then he also said that he raised money from his bookie. Because this bookie could pay him in cash and it was just originally for he says it was just originally for the investment in the first restaurant but then I rolled them into a small percentage into the overall company so. He doesn't talk about the percentages that wild bill has or bookie has but I just brought a smile to my face I just love the idea like what if what if like his bookie or wild bill this boilermaker. Somehow you know had five percent of raising canes which would be worth like a couple hundred million I just love the idea like this boiler maker or his book or Todd's bookie could have like you know a hundred million dollars of raising cane stock just because he believed in his chicken finger dream. So he saves up a bunch of money from boiling making is like okay I'm gonna listen to wild bill I'm gonna go up to Alaska and he says I was doing this when I was twenty three years old so I could live very cheaply. So literally before I got my job in Alaska I spent a month living in a tent on the tundra because you got to talk your way into getting on a boat. And so I'd be eating pork and beans and ramen noodles every day and just spending as little as you can this is a great example of this thing that you and I see over and over again in these biographies of these great entrepreneurs. How bad do you want it they will do just to get their dream going they will go to great lengths to do that the idea that you're willing to work ninety five hour weeks in a you know very tough environment as a boiler maker now you're literally risking your life on a boat. You know off the coast of Alaska so he spends the summer commercial fishing in Alaska and he says people are dying out there you're working twenty hour days you're sleeping an hour here or there. So imagine a kid on a chicken finger dream on the back of this boat national geographic is going out here to film this madness medical helicopters are taking people out you're hearing so and so boat just had a death and you're filling up the boat with fish. Waves are crashing over the side you're scared but I was there for that chicken finger dream so saved up a thing about fifty thousand dollars I love how I was I did a lot of things that were really stupid and really risky and just because it worked out for me I would not recommend you do you do it. And so he says this is something I would not recommend but I was young and dumb and back then you could get a bunch of credit cards I got as many credit cards as I could they were like eighteen twenty three percent and I lived off credit cards. I was young and I had nothing to lose but I don't think that's a great strategy. So he's got credit cards backing him up he's got the money he saved then he goes and gets an sba loan he says I use all these people in the services that are set up by our government sba small business development center service core retired executives. I talk to everybody that I thought was smart in business to get advice on how to raise money for this sorry raise my own money I got the preferred shareholder money that's what he's talking about the money while bill gave him the money. That his book he gave him and then he got a fifty thousand dollar sba loan and that was the seed capital that I needed to start the first restaurant so in while he's telling the story one of the people interviewing him. Ask them you know we have a lot of different entrepreneurs in the show some say you should use you should always do opium which is other people's money some founders say no no use as much of your own money as possible. And so like how do you think about this and I think by now you're going to know how to thinks about it and he goes I'm the latter I put all of my own money in. I go full speed so I own over 90% of my business it is a multi billion dollar business and we're continuing to grow over 30% it is very rare that I meet someone that owns that larger percentage of a business when you talk about businesses that are worth multi billions of dollars. And I think some of these private equity people come in and they tell these entrepreneurs this is what you need to do you can take money off the table now because you never know someone's going to stop coming and buying your product and then these entrepreneurs get whittled down so low they get diluted so much. And for me that takes a lot of your own spirit out because you're making money for people that just put cash in but that's the easy part you making your brand successful is hard man. You live it every day you do this stuff and then these people get bewildered talking about these entrepreneurs. They eventually just sell out we have a lack of founders in big businesses especially in the restaurant business when I was a kid these businesses were run by their founders founders care about their people they care about their customers they care they care they care and then I also think this is why if you just look at the product he's putting out the marketing he does. The financial performance he has he's smoking everybody because he's competing against non founders they're just and he'll talk about like. You know later on he's asked like what is the biggest threat to your business like who are you worried about and I promise you his answer when we get there is not I'm worried about McDonald's. The founders been dead for decades he's just not worried about that and so that's another thing he put he preaches like we need more founders founder led businesses are just better businesses. This leads to the idea of something I was talking about like if you truly love what you do and you're working on your best ideas like your extra you should be death that is your extra strategy. Steve jobs worked until he died Charlie monger worked till he died Coco Chanel till she died and so far all these people over and over again there were the extra strategy was death. And so his whole thing was people always ask me hey man what's your extra strategy I don't have one is a multi generation business I wouldn't sell. People need to have a higher risk tolerance because if you're an entrepreneur that's just what you do my risk tolerance was very very high. But try to keep as much equity as you can because this is yours so I guess that section mind me of Dietrich mattresses founder of Red Bull reminds me of James Dyson founder of Dyson still 100% of his business might be Michael Bloomberg. So it's 100% of Bloomberg if you think of the founder Red Bull who just passed away recently that's one of my favorite episodes I've ever done episode 333 there was no biographies in English about district mattresses so we had to translate one from German. To do that episode but he owned him and his partner so he owned 49% and his other his partner on 49% they were paying themselves like five the dividends every year between 500 800 million a year. And then they were turning down offers his 49% would be worth at least 20 billion dollars he could have taken off the table if he sold. And he just absolutely refused he's like I don't want to take the company public I'm never selling it and now just like Todd Todd wants to pass the business onto his his kids. It's exactly what Dietrich did Dietrich pass his part of the business onto his son go let's go back to he's got the money the first one takes a while to get it up. But it's starting to cash flow a lot of the businesses think you're it's right next to college you're going on on a Friday or a Thursday or Saturday having a little drink so hit the main business for raising canes at the very beginning. Was that like late night business I think they'd stay open to like three in the morning and Todd wouldn't get out of there to like five in the morning. But he was talking about the hardest part of growing the business is not going from you know 700 800 it was going from one to two because he didn't know what he was doing he didn't have any help. The hardest growth for me was from one store to two the first restaurant to the second restaurant I didn't do it the right way because I didn't have a lot of bench strength or management in my business. I lived at that restaurant we were open seven days a week most nights until three a.m. after we had to stay open till after the bars closed I would get out of there at five a.m. And I would turn right around the next morning and do it all over again I didn't really know how to develop other leaders and so this is the time. When they open the second restaurant that's when his partner's like hey I gotta get out of here and so the way that Todd describes this part making a lot of mistakes. He's like I was trying to build a plane while I was flying it and his whole point the advice he gives other entrepreneurs like you're gonna make a lot of mistakes. You've got to go in with the mindset that you're gonna make a lot of mistakes and be okay with it you want to make mistakes fast but fix them even faster. And so you know this guy's he says he has a very high risk tolerance I think it's been obvious so far for what you and I've talked about. And so he's got to you know there's certain cash flow but they have a lot of mistakes it doesn't have a lot of talent. But there's a bunch of these like double drive through burger joints in Louisiana that go out of business. And he's like I gotta take an opportunity because I can expand from two I think he adds another five stores really rapidly so from two to seven. By taking over these double drive through burger joints so you can't even walk inside there is no walking inside right. And what he realized like I could convert them for about a hundred thousand dollars and the way he could do that rather cheaply is because. They had a bunch of equipment that he could utilize and he's like I had to do this your cheapest way I could. And I need to open up as fast as possible because he's got to get to the cash flow as possible and he'll talk about how he finances all this growth in a minute. And so we do that is like okay just repurpose use their equipment instead of making burgers or making chicken fingers. And so the landlords were just sitting on these because all these double drive through burger joints had just went out of business and so he goes to the landlord says hey. I can get in really fast I want to lease this from you but I want to utilize all the equipment can we do like a package deal. And so they could turn around fast they could turn each round for a hundred thousand dollars and so he does four of these I think he does one in he does one in like a food court in a mall. He comes up with a very unique way to finance all this okay because remember it's really not investable there were really no venture capital at the time. He's got to figure out a way to make him you know somebody that the banks would want to loan to. And he goes this is how I finance this and I do not recommend this. But what I would go I would go to an angel investor and I'd say hey invest two hundred fifty thousand dollars and a subordinated subordinated debt note. I will give you a 50s we sound angel investor I will give you a I will guarantee you a 15% return and I will personally sign I will personally obligate myself to this. We he goes I want it on a one page contract nothing bigger than one page. We have a proven concept where cash flowing but I personally signed for this then I would take this and bring it down to the local community bank. They would look at this and say oh you have two hundred fifty thousand dollars they've considered this equity and I could borrow up to a million dollars off that deal. And so this is how we did it and he goes he's on operating on a nice edge when he's doing this okay so has to he has to open up as fast as possible. Okay if he opens up day one people are going to come in they're going to he's going to have some amount of revenue coming in day one. Okay and what he realizes is okay we open a restaurant so we got some revenue day one the crew members we have two weeks to pay them. The food my suppliers I don't have to pay for 30 days the rent I can pay 30 days later so I'm making cash flow and he has to make sure that he is making enough that he can make his payroll in two weeks. And then two weeks after that that he could start paying for the food that he sold 30 days earlier now this winds up working and he goes I did this this this is how we finance growth. Up to his first 28 restaurants and he said we were just rolling and rolling and rolling but I was leveraging myself horribly and and this is when he almost goes out of business. I'm going to stop there though because these creative you know these creative ways to finance things. When you're starting on you don't have a lot of money that one of my favorite biographies that I've ever read for the podcast I discovered it's getting Daniel Ludwig it's episode 292. The name of the biography is called the invisible billionaire and the reason it's called that is because in the 80s I think Daniel was the richest American and no one knew who he was. And he started out I mean he had a he was a building is huge conglomerate that he owned a hundred that he owned completely had no partners 200 companies in 50 countries. But he started out by shipping by transporting oil for standard oil because the government had broken them up. And he came up with no money but not enough money to do what he wants to do so he came up with this idea called the two paper to name paper arrangement which is the foundation of his incredible wealth. And the genius of Ludwig's financing method work like this he would approach an oil company secure a long term charter agreement to ship their petroleum. Then using that charter as collateral he'd go to a bank and obtain a loan to either build or renovate a ship specifically to fulfill that charter. The oil company would then make payments directly to the bank which and then the bank would deduct the loan payment and deposit any remainder into Ludwig's account. So the financing innovation was particularly brilliant because number one it used other people's credit which is the oil companies which had obviously better credit credit ratings at the time and Ludwig did. Two it required minimum personal investment on Ludwig's part and three it resulted in Ludwig owning valuable assets free and clear after the contracts inspired so I thought that was very interesting for some reason that popped in my mind. When I was thinking about you know him doing the subordinated debt loan so he's like I'm rolling we're adding restaurant after restaurant we have 20 restaurants. But I'm leveraged horribly very nervous and then he's in Louisiana hurricane Katrina hits and 21 out of his 28 restaurants go dark. He says my cash flow stops I'm in a bind and so there's a there's several examples. Especially if you have a better product than all your competitors how he's he turns hurricane Katrina into a tragedy into an asset and he does the same thing in the pandemic and I'll explain both of these to you right now. So hurricane Katrina hits everything's flooded he rallies his team together cyclists and we need to get open as quickly as possible for two reasons one. Our crew needs to come back they need to make money and our communities need food and two if we don't we're out of business we're done. So he was the very first restaurant to open back up in these communities they got destroyed by hurricane Katrina now why does that matter because he had a 90 day window. When he was the only restaurant open in the area and he says we crushed it we absolutely crushed it and so think about all the new customers have made have never tried raising canes before they try it because there's literally nothing else open and like oh this is really good and they're state customers for life they recommend to all these other people. But that's not the lesson that he wanted us to learn from this he says but the lesson of all this is what I tell entrepreneurs don't do that because my dream almost died my dream almost went away I was over leverage and stupid and so. Hurricane Katrina wind up being an opportunity unintended the pandemic actually turned into an opportunity as well so in 2020. The reason came to us doing one point five billion in revenue four years later that four and a half billion and Todd reaction to both crisis was. That he says this entrepreneurial thing just kicks in and you and he says we ain't going to stop man we're gonna get open and we're gonna make this work. And the pandemic wind up being you know a blessing in disguise because we had a great format because we could do all the drive if you remember during the pandemic drive through for open but you couldn't like go and sit inside our restaurant and the government said that you know you have to stay open because people need to eat and so this is he was labeled an essential business. And same things like one of the few areas that had all these drive throughs open and they stayed open to the entire pandemic he says sales were insane and as a result that that huge growth from one point five billion to four point five billion three years like we had to learn to get better and we had to learn to get better and quicker. And very fascinating he talks about both both examples was the fact that he's the ultimate decision maker like he does have partners in some board directors he doesn't shareholders so he can just say hey we're gonna do this and it's going to happen. And so he says I don't have to answer to anybody my but my crew members and my customers I can make decisions and immediately we can do all this stuff. I didn't have to go to shareholders I didn't have to go to a board that might say hey I don't know if it's safe to do that you wait another two weeks what are our competitors doing I don't have to answer anybody but my crew and my customers so I can get out there and make things happen right away. And there's a line that Michael Bloomberg says in his autobiography which I covered all the back on episode two twenty eight that I think Todd grace would agree with and Michael Bloomberg said answering to no one is the ultimate situation so. In the middle of this interview I want to pull something out because he's constantly talking about the fact that like he cares he cares he cares founders care we need more founder read founder led businesses. And you know this is when he has 800 locations it's worth all this money it's growing like crazy and he's doing this interview and right before the interview started. Todd's crew comes in and they're literally showing him the real the Instagram real the video that they're about to post. And the guy interviewing is like in my head I'm thinking Todd you're one of the three hundred fifty richest people in the world running this giant company and you're checking the wheels to make sure that everything aligns with the brand. Again I don't think of Todd graves in that situation think of how it relates to every single the person you and I talk about. Because if you have this idea that you use by all these people didn't know each other were alive at different times work in different industries obvious what is it telling you it's a good idea you should use in your business. See I did this episode called how Steve jobs kept things simple it's episode three forty nine said Steve I pulled it a line from the transcript. When I got this section Steve did not believe in delegating marketing and advertising decisions at all this is not an exaggeration he approved every single image that was used in an ad he would approve every single word he would deliberate over the copy. He is calling Ken who's running his ads the guy writing the book he's calling Ken at midnight to talk about a single word. Another idea that Todd repeats over and over again you have to make your people feel appreciated he says he has this great line says communicate the appreciation have with your people and with them constantly so he actually has an entire department dedicated to this. And he talks about this later but. He learned the right way to do something by seeing it done the wrong way first so he says in high school and college I worked in all these restaurants. And they would yell at you and say you're doing it wrong negative reinforcement doesn't work in my business if you go through a raising canes you're going to see a bunch of happy smiling people. But they're going to crank out food as quickly and as high quality as they can good quality comes from positive motivational management I go through all my kitchens and see all my crews all over the country. I go to the kitchen I say hey man nice toast hey thanks for the hard work I appreciate it positive positive positive they know I care about them and they work even harder and so he has this thing called the canes love department. I created a department in the business actually called canes love and it talks about respecting rewarding and recognizing crew members so some some things as simple as you come in and cover ship a shift. And you went out and you clean the dumpster you're like hey here's a gift card man thank you so much for doing this and these men and women work so hard so they know it's all about canes love. And he'll do like fun things for them to use really great at marketing and so there was I guess there was like this huge lottery is like 800 worth like 800 million or something I think this might have been in Louisiana. And he's like well we have 50,000 crew members at the time let's buy lottery tickets you know just be fun each tickets like two bucks cost us 100 grand and we'll agree that if any one of the 50,000 people. Win this 810 million dollar prize we're gonna we're gonna share the winnings and the reason he said this because he's like the crew members are all talking about the lottery they were like fascinated by it's like okay well you know let's just everybody by in the company. And we pulled this all together and the point was you know this is really just a fun deal but then it went viral. And he didn't do this to go viral but he's like okay he does a lot of these things out of his marketing budget he's got a big marketing budget. And his whole point was just like well you know I got millions and millions of impressions it's on like to the today show it's on the news it's in like local media and it costs 100,000 dollars. And so it wind up being a great recruiting tool because people are like hey I want to go work at a company that literally has a founder that wants to do fun stuff so great for recruiting great for marketing and then wind up being a great return on 100,000 dollar marketing spent. And there's a lot of similarities between like Todd graves in Sam Walton where Todd just just really focuses on a simple idea you know taking very seriously. But also in the way he thinks about the people that work inside of his company Sam Walton said that if you're not serving the customer or supporting the folks who do that we don't need you inside of Walmart. And Todd graves version eyes my crew is my number one focus the company's leaderships serve our crew members who are serving our customers. Again I would go after that go after this and compare you know the marketing of fast food other fast food competitors compare what raising canes is doing and compare him to you know his competitors they're just a lot better at this. And so he talks about learning social media as a grown man so he says being an entrepreneur and starting out with a budget you have to be really crafty and marketing your business. This started for me all the way back in 1996 I would go and hand out flyers and say come try this new place raising canes back then we didn't have social media. But for me I'm always a student in my business I'm learning constantly I want to stay on the edge and I want to keep getting better and better and so when social media came out he says look I'm an older guy I'm 52 OK so I didn't naturally gravitate towards Facebook and Instagram and things like that. But I watch the marketing value behind it and one of the most interesting things is launching collaboration so there's a like I said before a lot of like huge celebrities are obsessed with raising canes they kind of grew up on it over time Todd graves is become friends with with this musician in post Malone. And when he starts becoming friends with Todd he's like man how can I own a canes like I want to own a canes Todd's telling me so well you know that's not our model we don't do franchises I like to do open company restaurants because you know I want control I'm obsessed with. Keeping control and keeping the quality. Impostor was like come on man we got to figure something out I want to I want to own a canes I want to own a canes. And so Todd goes okay let me let me think about this for a little bit and so he turned a couple days later he's like hey what if we do. Like a post Malone version of raising canes you know you design we're going to call it like posty canes or something like that same menu but like you design like. You can design what it looks like and I think the first one's like bright pink and it's like kind of crazy and I think some of the decor is like tattoos that post Malone has just go have fun like make something super special and then we'll do is we'll just share in the profits. And what was fascinating is the way that Todd thought about this is like I'm not setting up another entity right this is not a separate company we're operating on a corporate level the post Malone raising canes. This is just part of our marketing budget so I think there's like two of them now and they're just they get ton of coverage you know outside of raising canes posting about it or marketing about it because people are so like they're so weird and so they're covered by the people and so like oh this is just a marketing expense. And then we'll just say hey these two stores this is how much revenue the brown there's so much expenses and we'll just share the profits and those profits that they they send to post Malone they just consider that a marketing expense now. He there's something that he said to post Malone where he's like hey you know I don't this isn't our model I don't do franchises and so this is why he does a franchise and this is why he wants corporate owned stores. He says most quick service restaurants are franchise models you lose a lot of control when you do that I would rather open company restaurants because I can control them I want these things run exceptionally well it's personal to me. Remember what I said about Pat Riley using it's personal to me he says it's easier to compete against these big corporate non founder led companies because they just don't care and so he says in big corporate America it's not a personal decision. It's a financial decision that they're doing it's different for people that care he repeats over and over again you know the fact that it's a like raising canes is a founder led company. That everything is personal to him and he's got a great way to describe this he says I believe God made me good at this for a reason Todd graves is a missionary and just like Jeff Bezos says missionaries make better products. And so hope push that idea hope preach idea the fact that we need more founder companies. It's the exact when a young founder comes to him and ask him for advice about what he should do it's exact opposite what the guys in the bank did when he was young he says when I talked entrepreneurs they have an idea I encouraged them if you have your own concept to start that open that. And the reason is by having entrepreneurs open more stuff it gets diversity of thought diversity of ideas diversity of different ways to do things and as a result everybody gets better from more founders trying new things. And so the follow up question that was you've been approached with these big dollar amounts these big checks what was the most enticing time or dollar amount that you were approached with you know keep in mind he's been offered billions of dollars he goes it's it was never enticing at all. And the reason why is I believe God made me good at chicken fingers to help people I think God makes us all good at what we're doing ultimately to help people. And one of the other things that he says for like for entrepreneurs like this there's actually two essentially the way the note I left myself on this was what assets do you have that you're not currently using okay so. On my computer monitor on my desk I have two post-it notes that are reminders to myself they think are both exactly how Todd graves things number one do one thing says do one thing relentlessly and the second one says what assets do I have that I'm not currently using. And you know that doesn't mean financial assets necessarily. And so Todd's points like yeah okay well maybe you're young and you're starting out you have no money but you have assets that older rich people don't have and it's the fact that you know you have a ton of energy. And he says Todd didn't have a lot of money or experience when he started but he had useful energy and determination I was 23 when I opened up I was 24 I could just outwork everybody I didn't have to sleep much I was a young man. And so it's like yeah I'm gonna have a lot of money but it's what you know how to us when you're 23 or 24 you can I could sleep for a few hours get up the next day and feel fine. You can't do that when you're very much harder to do that when you're you're much older and I think one of the most important things about like yeah. I give a lot of these talks or you know these interviews or whatever and something I repeat is like I'm just not really interested in like your first business I'm interested in your last business. I'm interested in the business that like you know to me the large part of life is like understanding yourself and then having all these experiences in many cases is going to. require you to start many you know multiple businesses very rare for Todd for a person like Todd graves to start his first business that's going to be his last business. But I'm always obsessed like and I asked this question to the founders I mean it's like is this your last business. Like is this the end for you like saying that like I'm about to quote Sam Walton in a minute same thing it's like once I want film Walmart wasn't going to do anything else he was going to keep doing that. One of the reasons I think that is important is because things grow over time and mysterious ways that you could have never possibly predicted and I see this over and over again in the books. And he's talking about I had this idea was like oh actually like location matters, so the average raising canes does about 6.5 million a year in sales. Now that puts him in an average store basis in his industry he's in second behind Chick-fil-A for QS ours. And so the average reason he's a do six and a half million, but they opened up one in Times Square and that one did 22 million its first year. So that if you pause and actually think about that so okay where can you go that you what you offer is the exact same product. But you actually sell like for X more that's an interesting thought to sit and think about and then I was also thinking I was like I am positive that when Todd had that first store. He wasn't thinking you know outside the North Gates of LSU that one day I'm going to have a raisin canes that does 22 million in sales. It took him 30 years to get to that point and that's the important part is like get to you should be in a rush to get to your last business. Because the longer that goes on things grow in mysterious and unpredictable ways and you see it over and over again now I also thought it was interesting there's a there's a idea. That really popped my mind you know I've read every single thing I could find about Sam Walton he's one of the founders I most admire I think it was on like the fourth podcast I made about him before I really really clicked. This idea of like go slow now to so you can go faster later on in one of the interviews he's saying hey we're pushing over 600 locations. After almost 25 years of business and I think that interview was three years ago and so now they have over 800 years or 800 stores rather. And he goes it blows me away we're about to start cranking about 100 years so it seems like he's right on that trajectory that he said a few years ago. He talks about another thing I need to before I get to the same Walton part Todd says I approve every site every location everyone. Remember Walt Disney the advice that he gave to you and I from the grave if we lose the details we lose everything I bet you Todd if I asked him and if you know Todd graves please send him this episode because I'd love to meet him. I bet you fast them did you agree with what Walt Disney's advice if we lose the details we lose everything if we lose the details we lose everything so. What's fascinating to me is okay took him 25 years. To get to 600 locations and in two years three years he had another 200 there's this book called Sam Walton richest man in America it's episode 354 this is when it clicked for me after reading about him multiple multiple times and again I think it was the fourth episode done on. Wait a minute back up Sam Walton when he started retail career the first five years of his retail career he had one store so in the beginning of his career he could only able to make to you still learning he can make five years you can make one store in five years. Then you get to what is this I think 30 years into his career he opens the same club he goes from 0 to 1 billion in sales in three years he goes from 0 stores on day one. To seven years in having a hundred and five stores so if you think about that that's a slightly longer time frame the first five years career he has. One store three decades into his career he goes from 0 to a hundred and five in seven years I pulled this quote from the transcript. Of this episode extreme patients coupled with an extreme intolerance for slowness that is the career of Sam Walton something else that appears over and over again when you hear Todd graves. Speak again people like I love what you do why don't you change the thing and he is so relentlessly stubborn about this that I love. And he says our number one strategy for growth is staying true to who we are that means staying true to our one love and that's quality chicken finger meals never losing that focus that's our concept doing one thing and doing it better than anybody else. It is important for leaders to retain a singular focus I would encourage anybody in the business and anybody in business to find your one true love. My one love is chicken fingers and I strive to be the best at that lock in on what you do exceptionally well and then execute it every day day in and day out that is how you win. Not trying to be all things to all people is so important because if you try to be all things to all people you're not anything to anybody. Goes back to this founder mentality that he has he says every box that goes out to every customer matters to me. This is a personal business to him this is a family business to him he was asked what lessons that he learned from his father. He says my father taught me about hard work he taught me about about the importance of being polite to people he was teaching me values I do the same thing with my kids now. I tell them the most important thing you could ever do is to be kind to be kind be kind be kind to people man and so why he's giving this interview some of these interviews his kids are like sitting. He brings his kids with him very similar to like what you and I have been talking about over and over and over again about these wildly successful businesses. And what they all do is they bring their kids into the business they expose them to the business really early I'm talking about the Wallenbergs we talked about them Hattie Green Jerry Jones Leon Hess. Just go back and listen to like last like six or seven episodes this thing comes up over and over again and so he and Todd Grace talks about this I like to bring my son with me when i'm doing business and be exposed to it he's just 17. But it's good to good to get that stuff into his head he involves his daughter as well why because he wants to give he wants to pass this down. To his kids I want my kids in the business to be able to carry on the values after their mom and I are gone they can turn this this business into a worldwide business and continue to grow it. And then he's constantly repeating the importance of like you know the experts what experts like don't listen to experts listen to your gut listen to your intuition. In fact one time he I loved it because when he said the word experts I was watching the podcast to any like put it in quotation marks he's like experts sure. It really reminds me of Henry Ford like Todd the way Todd thinks about experts and how big of a detriment they can be to an entrepreneur is the exact same way that Henry Ford thought about it you know 120 years ago. And so he says the experts are always like hey you guys really need to add a chicken finger salad you know you need to jump on the health trends. And when I was younger I listened a little more because I'm like wait maybe these people are smarter than me maybe they know more than me but my gut said no. Staying true to what I've done not listening I know who I am and I'm not trying to be all things to all people so there's a great line in Henry Ford's. Autobiography where he's talking about you know. It sounds crazy if you have never studied this part of of entrepreneurial history when Henry Ford starts making. Automobiles you know he was a big believer in internal combustion engine at the time there wasn't many cars in the world on the road, but the ones that were on the road they were all either steam powered or electric cars. And you know you have this young mechanically inclined gifted gifted mechanically inclined kid saying actually you know what i'm going to try to build in a different way i'm going to try to. You the power source is going to stay with the car and I think this internal combustion engine actually has a future and everybody told Henry Ford no. You cannot do that just like I told Todd graves you cannot cannot build a 10 billion dollar business doing one thing relentlessly and just serving chicken fingers I love there's another thing I always say. Oh my God so people told I forgot to say this is too funny and this is like I recruited so many people to go to raising canes. Good that they haven't had it because I just love his approach to what he does and so people were telling Todd graves okay you sell chicken fingers. But you need a chicken sandwich he goes oh you want a chicken sandwich i'm going to take take three of my chicken fingers and put them into. Between two slices of bread there's your freaking chicken chicken sandwich and that's literally if you order a chicken sandwich. At reason gains it's just three of the chicken fingers between two slices of bread it's hilarious but i want to go back to Henry Ford okay he says. I do not recall anyone who thought that the internal combustion engine could ever have more than a limited use all these wise people demonstrated conclusively that the engine could not compete with steam. They never thought that it might carve out a career for itself that is the way with wise people they are so wise and clever. They are so wise and practical that they know they always know down to a dot just why something cannot be done they always know the limitations. That's why I never employ an expert in full bloom if I ever wanted to kill opposition my opposition by unfair means. I would endow the opposition with experts they would have so much good advice that I could be sure that they would do little work and so he goes back to this idea hey. My gut said no staying true to what i've done not listening knowing who I am and not trying to be all things to all people is very important. He says i've stuck with that one love brother same menu since day one that has been a big key to my success stay focused. Everything on my menu has to be exceptional so one of the thing they offer is you can get freshly brewed tea he goes I sourced that tea. I know the tea leaves the quality leaves that are coming in for our freshly school for the freshest grease tea I can this is the important part the idea of. Really powerful idea of limiting the amount of details to perfect and then making every detail perfect limit the amount of details to perfect and then make every detail perfect he goes I can laser focus on all these items being great. And then this is where one of my favorite parts I just burst it out laughing and he talks about. You know bring in people that are smarter than you in their own respective ways that does not mean when you do that that you stop being detail oriented. It doesn't mean that you're not into the details people will just say delegate he says delegate what kind of word is that that's what I bust out laughing is one of my favorite things he said. People will say just delegate delegate what kind of word is that work with great leaders but still be in the details you should be in the details. People used to tell me the experts again you won't always know that the things are going on in your business you can't do these things when you get big well i'm bigger than all of them now. And then he brings up the fact that this is not unique to him this is a business I didn't even know i'm constantly discovering all these like family run businesses absolutely love a lot of these people listen to the podcast and that's how I meet him. But he goes he was asking the person everyone who's he goes you know edition Edison quest. I think saying quest so I couldn't I had to Google on it finally found this guy it's it's CHO you est you know Edison quest he built a huge company multi billion dollar company. He is that they build like ships and it's funny you go to the websites like looks like it was made in like 1997 but they have this wildly successful business. He's a huge ship builder massive company he goes he built a huge company multi billion dollar company he got he even got down to the details in his business to know how much the how much they were spending on bottle waters. Because there was this rampant spending and waste on bottle waters no one was looking at it and he said look this is what Edison said he said look it's not just about bottle waters our company makes billions of dollars this carries over to everything else. It was him staying in the details the most successful people I know stay in the details and it is easier to stay in the details if you truly love it like last night you know it was funny because you know I read. A lot of people give me the same advice like you shouldn't edit your podcast you shouldn't do it but maybe you don't know this maybe doing this like. You know I know a bunch of other partners with founders is literally the only podcast that is made by one a single person. A single person I do all the reading the research the recording the editing social media post everything it's just like it's what I want to do you don't work. Your entire life to get to be able to do what you love to not do it and so like I was chuckling to myself last night because. I was going over and what I've been doing is like after I'm done with all my reading I feel there's been like a lot of value spending a day or two with material. And keep re reading it and most mostly just like eliminating things that that I don't think I need to talk about anymore and really like focusing. And so it's laughing like last night Saturday I just happened to Saturday night I happen to glance at at the clock was nine oh five nine oh five PM on a Saturday night what I'm doing. I'm working on the podcast because it's fun to me is what I want to do and so all the advice that Todd is giving us is a lot easier to do if you love what you do because he says like this is my chicken finger dream. My business card says founder chairman CEO fry cook cashier I like working for our lines I like working drive-thru I love the pace of the business I like cooking. And guess what say you wanted to jump in and you're like I'm going to make a chicken finger QSR chain to good luck competing with something like that the guy likes to work the line good luck. And so this leads to another question I love who do you fear most in the chicken game you know by now there's no way he's going to answer you know. Some giant non founder led you know corporate chain and he says the thing that gets me that worries me the most is the young person that has the fire of Todd graves going that wants to come and compete directly. They say hey I'm gonna go head to head with canes I'm gonna do the same thing they do and this is what I love I love his response because member there's a reason why I started our conversation with that pilot Riley quote that is personal to me. And so he says I'm gonna do the same thing they do he goes it's just Todd grace it's so personal to me. And he's like if you want to compete with me that's fine you better get up early in the morning and you better work late at night man because this is what we do this is part of my DNA this is a representation of my family. So you better come with all your guns if you're going to compete with raising canes because this is my world. And so if he's speaking about his business like that you know the question he gets this question over and over again sometimes from people interviewing sometimes people calling in. Like why did you never sell off part of the business after being offered billions he goes I didn't want private equity partners I wanted to own and control it I wanted to work hard for that vision because I know this is my purpose when you this is one of my favorite lines to when you create and do you're never going to stop creating and doing because it's part of what you are it's part of your D. And a and then again he's always at ask like what is your advice you know you're one of the most successful people on the planet you've done it your way. You know you're still doing it what is your advice to other entrepreneurs and he says why are you here what is your purpose you need to answer that honestly. I think sometimes it can be scary even to hear what the answer is it can be a little scary because when you lock into something and you do it it becomes your life's work i'm so glad he said that because one of my favorite things. You're ready with Kobe Bryant said Kobe Bryant was giving a talk in front of a bunch of young people. Surely before he died and remember what what Todd Graves just said you gotta like you gotta answer honestly man like you can't lie yourself really ask what is your purpose why are you here. And it's gonna be a little scary because that means you're gonna have to lock into that that means you are foreclosing all the opportunities you're making that your life's work is not very few humans ever get ever do that. And so Kobe says the greatest fear we faces ourselves it's not anything that's external it's not anything that's superficial. I think the greatest fear you face is yourself because we all have dreams and it's very scary sometimes to accept that dream that you have and it's scary still to say okay I want that. It's scary because you're afraid that if you put your heart and soul into it and you fail then how are you going to feel about yourself. So being fearless means putting yourself out there and going for it no matter what go for it not for anybody else. But for yourself and I think it's a perfect lead into the final question the final piece of advice that Todd Graves has for you and I he's asked what is one secret you could leave us with if you're committed. If you're really committed then tell yourself you're not going to give up because I've seen so many entrepreneurs give up because it's so hard it's so hard to get finance it's so hard to get a location it's so hard to do these things so they give up. So never ever give up and be fanatical you've got to be fanatical you've got to be fanatical about what you're doing nothing ever happens unless someone pursues a vision fanatically.
