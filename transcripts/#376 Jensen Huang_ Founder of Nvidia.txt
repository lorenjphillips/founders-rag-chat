--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's an idea in this book where it says Jensen prioritized technical skill and maximum effort above all. And as I was reading, I noticed a lot of similarities between the way Jensen thought and ran his company with the way that Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos thought and ran their companies as well. In fact, from day one in Jeff Bezos's very first shareholder letter, Jeff wrote about the importance and emphasized the importance of having the very best team. He wrote, Jeff's focus on talent is very similar to this quote that I found from Steve Jobs in an interview that Steve gave that very same year in 1997. And this is what Steve Jobs said. He said, And what the best person could accomplish was 50 or 100 to 1, given that you're well advised to go after the cream of the cream. He said you want to build a team that pursues the A-plus players. And this is exactly what Ramp did. Ramp has the most talented technical team in their industry. Becoming an engineer at Ramp is nearly impossible. In the last 12 months, they hired only 0.23% of the people that applied. When you use Ramp, you now have top tier technical talent and some of the best AI engineers working on your behalf 24-7 to automate and improve all of your business's financial operations. And they do this all on a single platform. That means the longer that you use Ramp, the more efficient your company becomes. This is important because as Sam Walton said in his autobiography, you can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you're too inefficient. Ramp helps you run an efficient organization. In the end of that interview that Steve Jobs gave, he added, It sounds like this customer review that I read, which said that Ramp is like having a teammate who you never need to check in on because they have it handled. Ramp gives you everything you need to optimize all your financial operations on a single platform. Ramp's website is incredible. Make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today. That is ramp.com. So the book that I want to talk to you about today is the NVIDIA way Jensen Wong and the making of a tech giant and is written by Tae Kim. The book is a company history of NVIDIA. But that is not what I want to talk to you about. I want to talk to you about how the founder Jensen has learned to run his company after decades of experience and learning and practice and failure and pain. And so there is 19 different ideas that popped out to me and there's like reoccurring themes. And I think they just steal an idea from Charlie Munger. Charlie Munger has this idea that he talks about over and over again. He talked about over and over again for decades. He talked about the Lollapalooza effect and how there's these economic and social implications of these different ideas inside of a company that interplay with one another. And the combination of them actually make the traits more powerful. And in typical Charlie Munger fashion he said, the person, the man who doesn't understand this is a damn fool. And so I organized my notes into this list of 19 ideas that I learned from Jensen, specifically how he runs his company from reading the book. Before I get there though, I got to take another idea from Munger where he talks about the importance of why he read so many biographies. And he says that when you're trying to teach the great concepts that work, I think it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who develop them. So before I get to my list of 19 ideas, I want to give you this brief overview of Jensen Wong's early life and then the prehistory of NVIDIA. And I think doing so will add context because Jensen runs NVIDIA in a very unique way. He has built, which I think all of us, he has in common with a lot of history entrepreneurs, he built a company building philosophy that is natural and authentic to him. He's been running the video for over three decades and I think it's impossible to do something for such a long period of time unless it is natural and authentic to you. So the one of the most important things that happened in Jensen's life happened when he was four years old. He was born in Taiwan. His father visits America. He goes to New York City and he realizes, oh, this is the land of opportunity. I want if I want the best opportunity for my two sons, I need to get them to America. And doing so had to feel like a daunting task to his father. Jensen's family did not have money. In fact, they didn't even have a lot of stability. They had to move around Taiwan depending on where his father could find work. They did not. The two brothers, Jensen and his brother, did not speak English. In fact, I thought it was very fascinating how Jensen's mother decided, hey, the kids need to go to America. And if they're going to America, they need to learn English. And so she would select 10 random words from the dictionary every day. She'd make her sons memorize the definition and learn how to spell the words. So 10 English words every single day. And so in addition to reading this book, I watched a bunch of interviews with Jensen. And he talks about the fact that he has he feels a great debt. The fact that sacrifices that his parents made to give him access to essentially unlimited opportunity. One of the great things about reading, you know, this is not technically a biography of Jensen, but it can function as one. And one of the reasons I've become an evangelist for reading biographies, I try to get people to read as many as possible. Because you're not really. Yes, we're studying and we're learning about the lives of other people, but it is natural. It's human nature to put yourself in their shoes and think about how their story or their ideas relate to your own. And this was, you know, actually surprisingly hit me like an emotional point because I was just thinking about the fact that, you know, this is outside of Jensen's control. He's four years old when this is happening. And yet the decisions that were made before Jensen even had a memory affected the entire trajectory of his life. And I thought about the fact that my paternal grandfather was born in Cuba. He died before I have no memory of him. He died when I was really young. I think I was actually four, as a matter of fact, maybe even younger. And yet I owe the entire trajectory of my life was changed by a decision of an uneducated, relatively poor man who was living in Cuba. He was 38 years old. He was working any kind of job. He worked as a butcher and in a factory that made shoes. You know, he was not a prosperous man. He was not an educated man. He was married. He had a baby. OK, a two year old. That's my dad. And he cast her takes over and he decides somehow he knew he's like, this is really bad. I have to get out of here. He winds up. Imagine living your entire life in a country. You're 30 years old. You have a wife and a kid. You don't have any money. You don't speak the language. And you just and you take that risk and you come to America and that decision based on somebody I don't have any memory of. Changed the entire trajectory of my of my life. This is the luckiest, the kindest thing ever anybody's ever done for me. The luckiest break I've ever had in my life. And I think there's a lot of similarities between the what his parents are willing to do, what Jensen's parents are willing to do. The fact that they send their their sons. Imagine sending your kids. They send Jensen and his brother to Washington to Tacoma, Washington to live with their aunt and uncle before they can get over to America themselves. And then what happens? They decide, OK, my my our boys are here. We know they need to get a good education. We're going to send them to an American boarding school. OK, so they think what they find this place called Anita Baptist Institute, which is located in Kentucky, to pay the tuition. Jensen's parents sell off all their possessions. Now, here's the problem. It's not a prep school. It's not a boarding school. I mean, technically a boarding school, but they thought the family thought it was a prep school. It is a school, a reform school for troubled young people. So really, the reason I want to add this like extra context for Jensen's early life for you is because I think this entire section and all the notes and stuff that I want to talk to you about before the founding of Nvidia and really the first like 10 years of the video to you could really summarize it by one of my favorite maxims in the history of entrepreneurship. And that is excellence is the capacity to take pain. Jensen has unfathomable levels. I can't I've not discovered the end of his capacity to take pain. He talks about this a lot. So there's two things actually happening at the reform school. I think a really important one. The school holds the students to a very strict routine and you have to work every single day, which Jensen does and loves to do now. The other thing that was beneficial to him that probably didn't feel beneficial to time is that the first few months Jensen was smaller and smaller and younger than than all of his classmates and they beat the crap out of him. His roommate at the boarding school was eight years older than Jensen and they said there's a great description in the book that he's covered in tattoos and scars from stab wounds. And so after getting his ass kicked a bunch, they wind up like finding his footing, gaining respect. He's obviously somebody that's that's not going to back down from a fight. And Jensen much later on in life is talking about this formative experience going to the school. And he says as a result of this experience, I don't get scared often. I don't worry about going places I haven't gone before. I can tolerate a lot of discomfort. So then the other the next thing I want to talk to you about is I want to fast forward. And at this point we find Jensen is already graduated college. He is working for a microchip company. It's AMD Advanced Micro Devices. And this is just his capacity to take pain. His he's got large. I would say he's got a lot of endurance and he's got a phenomenal work ethic. And so by day he's designing microchips at AMD. And at night and on weekends, he's married and has two kids, by the way. She's got a young family. He's got a full time job and he decides he wants to go to Stanford. He wants to get a master's degree. It's going to take him eight years to finish his master's degree because he can only go on nights and weekends and spare time while he's working and then raising his very young family. But again, he took away a very valuable lesson. He says I have a very long term horizon. I can be impatient about certain things, but infinitely patient about others. I plug away. And so here's another example that excellence is a capacity to take pain everywhere that Jensen works. Everywhere he goes, people realize he's really smart. And then he winds up getting promoted rapidly almost everywhere he's at. And there's this line in the book that's fantastic. It talks about like, why does he think that he was able to be propelled from scrubbing toilets to managing entire divisions of microchip of a microchip company? And he believes it's his willingness and ability to put in more effort and tolerate more suffering than anyone else. And again, this is something he repeats in a bunch of the interviews I watched with him as well. He says people with very high expectations have very low resilience. Resilience matters in success, Jensen said. Greatness is not intelligence. Greatness comes from character and in character in Jensen's view, it can only be gained and actually earned as a result of overcoming problems, setbacks, adversities and refusing to quit. Perseverance is one of I think Jensen's most valued traits. And it is also advice that he doles out. So if you were to ask Jensen, what is your advice on how to achieve success? His answer is relatively consistent over the years. He says, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering. So I want to get into a very important part of like the prehistory of Nvidia. And Jensen is working at this company called LSI Logic. And there's a few, actually, there's three important things that jumped out at me that I think were important for the time that Jensen spent at LSI Logic. One, he's going to pick up this maxim that he'll repeat throughout as he's building Nvidia. It's called honing the sword. And it's the idea that, again, this is something that Jensen has in common with Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs and a bunch of other people. But I want to give you two examples there that you should seek conflict. If you're working on something you care about, don't avoid confrontation. You actually seek conflict. And Jeff Bezos said the greatest example of this, he says, if I have to choose between agreement and conflict, I'll take conflict every time. Why? Because it always yields a better result. So they're having these explosive fights and arguments inside of like what to build, what direction, how to run the company. And he realizes that it might be temporarily uncomfortable to go through that experience when it's happening. But on the other side of that is a better idea, a more refined idea. So the reasons why it's called honing the sword. Honing the sword. How do you sharpen a sword? You hit it against a whetstone and doing that over and over and over again creates a sharper and a better sword. This one's becoming one of his main philosophies and one of the 19 things I want to talk to you about when we get there. But again, every time I read anything, it could be a book, an article, a tweet. I always think about like how does what I'm reading now relate to all the other, you know, 375 other books that you and I have studied on this podcast together. And so honing the sword actually reminded me of Steve Jobs rock tumbler story. So there's this great interview. I think it's called Steve Jobs, a lost interview. I think it occurred right before he went back to Apple. So it's right around 1997. So he tells a great metaphor. Steve, you know, master storyteller has a great metaphor for teams working on a product that they are passionate about. And this is what Steve said. Creating a little friction, creating a little noise had come out these beautiful polished rocks. It is through a group of incredibly talented people bumping up against each other, working together. They polish each other. They polish their ideas. So the first thing that happened when he's working outside logic, he grabs this one philosophy he's going to use, you know, for multiple decades into the future. The second thing, which is arguably the most important thing is this is where he's going to meet his future co-founders. And there's another maxim I want to put into your brain that reappears over and over again in the books all the time. Opportunity handled well leads to more opportunity. So Jensen is working at LSI, right? And he's assigned the Sun Microsystems account. He is going to meet. There's two gifted programmers and engineers. Jensen said this is one of the luckiest things that ever happened to him. The fact that he met Chris Malachowski and Curtis Preen. These are going to be his co-founders. So he is their liaison between Sun Microsystems where they work and LSI where Jensen works. And so Chris and Curtis actually get upset at Sun Microsystems. They decide to leave and they have this idea that they want to be consultants and advisors. They want to tell they want to essentially pitch Samsung on taking one of their ideas. And they're like, hey, we'll just, you know, design it. We'll be consultants for them. And they're like, wait a minute. We're like really good technologists. We might have a lot of technical brilliance, but we don't know anything about contracts or business really. We need to get somebody to help us. And they're like, who's the best person that can help us? And they loved working with Jensen so much and they thought he was so brilliant. They're like, oh, we immediately reach out to Jensen. So originally Curtis and Chris are like, hey, can you help us like write this contract for this idea that we want to pitch Samsung? We want to make sure we don't get screwed over. They start meeting and eventually Jensen's just like, well, why are we doing this for them? Why don't we start our own company? And that's why I think it's so important to repeat over and over again that opportunity handled well leads to more unexpected opportunity. You can never possibly predict the fact that, you know, every single job that Jensen does, he does the best possible job he can. And that as the time passes, as you read the book, as you go, as his life unfolds, that the fact that he handled the opportunity the best he did the best possible job he did unlocks all these other opportunities. I remember there's actually a great way to think about this. And one way I think about this all the time, like if you hear my own inner monologue, there's this basketball player, he's a young basketball player named Anthony Edwards. And he plays for the Timberwolves and they were like really outperforming what people thought they were going to do in the playoffs. And I heard one of his I saw a clip of one of his postgame interviews and I thought what he said was fantastic. And he had a very Anthony Edwards had a very simple like opera like modus operandi or way to approach thing. He's like, hey, I'm just trying to kill everything in front of me. I'm just trying to kill everything in front of me is another way of saying that whatever opportunities in front of me, I'm going to do the best damn job possible. And if I do that every day, that opportunity handle well is going to lead to more unexpected opportunity. Now, that's also combined with another Max and the unit talk about their relationships run the world. So Jensen's working for LSI. OK, he goes to the CEO, Wilfred Corrigan, and he's like, hey, I'm going to leave. I'm going to do this business with Curtis and Chris. And what is LSI CEO? The first thing he says, can I invest? Because he's like, you're you're brilliant. You're one of the smartest people at this company. And this this is the third reason that I wanted to talk about Jensen's time at LSI logic and how it was so important to the prehistory of Nvidia, because what is Corrigan do Corrigan actually introduces Jensen to Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia and Sequoia and Valentine had invested in LSI. Now, here's the reason I say opportunity handle well leads to more opportunity and relationships on the world. When Wilfred Corrigan calls Valentine, he's not saying, hey, you should these guys want to make graphics cards or they want to do what you didn't pitch them startup idea. He pitched Jensen. He's like, hey, this guy wants to start his own company. He's really smart. He is really good. You guys should go talk to him. Now, this is the fascinating thing, because not only did like Jensen gets this gets this introduction, they suffer his reputation. Jensen talks about this and something you and I will talk about later, too. And I think, again, another trait, I hate to repeat myself, but I have to because I think it's a repetition is persuasive. It's really important. Jensen has so many traits. He fits right in with all the people that you and I study. And one of them is this fierce habit of self criticism of never thinking anything is good enough. And so Jen, there's tons of highlights are quotes of the book where Jensen's just like, I suck. I cannot believe I did that. And he talks about the fact that when he goes and pitches what's going to be Nvidia to Don Valentine, he's like, my pitch was horrendous. I couldn't explain what I was building. I couldn't say who I was building a for. I couldn't even tell him why I was going to be successful. And yet the end of the meeting, Sequoia decides to invest. And there's a great quote on Don Valentine in this. He goes against my better judgment based on what you just told me. See, it's a crappy pitch. I'm going to give you my money. But if you lose my money, I will kill you. Valentine told him. And so Jensen's like, listen, the important takeaway here again, he goes to school and everybody. So your reputation reputation will precede you. They succeeded on the strength of your reputation, not their business plan, not their pitch. And this is a very important point because I always think of what there's a line where like, if you go and read Buffett shareholder letters and you go and watch his way, he answers questions at the AGM. And you can go see these YouTube videos where he actually testifies in front of Congress. You'll see that Buffett for probably over four decades talks about the fact that you have to be very and you should be making all your decisions that protect your long term reputation in mind. In fact, when Buffett is testifying in front of Congress, when that he was going to the Salomon Brothers scandal, he talks about the fact that he told he's telling the congressman that he told everybody inside the organization that if you lose, you can lose money for the firm. I won't be understanding. You lose a single shred of reputation and I will be ruthless. He put that into the congressional record. And again, I think he talks about the fact that, you know, the reason is, is because if you're making decisions with the importance of your long term reputation in mind, that's going to pay dividends. And it can also destroy and abort future opportunities. If you have a bad reputation, Jensen says the same thing. It's like it is a lesson that Jensen would never forget. Your reputation will precede you. Obviously it pays dividends in business. I was thinking about this with Brad Jacobs. I became friends with Brad Jacobs as a result of this podcast. Brad is on his I've lost count eight, nine. I think he's on his ninth separate billion dollar company. And when I'm reading this part, when I got to this part about about Jensen, I was like, you know what? Brad Jacobs could do a horrible job with a pitch to yet because of his track record, because of his reputation. The fact that his great reputation precedes him. If he's starting a new project or he wants to raise money for his new company, he's going to have a line out the door around the block and down the street, waiting for people to invest in him and his next idea because of that track record, because of that reputation. So there's just a few more things before we get to this list of 19 ideas that I want to spend. Hopefully the bulk of the conversation you and I are going to have today. But I do have to get to the beginning of the video because it's funny. He describes this because I went back and actually looked at like the financial performance of the video and the market cap is almost like this harshness that that Jensen applies to himself, which I think is a good idea. If you're listening to this, you probably do this. I definitely do this to myself, but he kind of describes her first fit five to 15 years of the company is like just a series of fuck ups. And I just want to get to this idea of well, I'll just give you some background. Their first plot product, right, is a flop and it's called the envy one. And so Jensen is actually doing like this postmortem and he realized they made several critical mistakes with the envy one. And so I'm going to read a section from the book to you. So some of these critical mistakes from the envy one starts from positioning to product strategy. Product strategy says they had overdesigned the card, stuffing it with features. No one cared about the market simply wanted the fastest, fastest graphics performance for the best games at a decent price and nothing else. The envy one could simply could simply not stack up against other cards that were more narrowly designed. This is what Jensen said. We learned it was better to do fewer things well than to do too many things. Nobody goes to the store to buy a swish army knife. It is something that you get for Christmas. So that's an idea that James Dyson realized. So my number one recommendation for out of every single book that I've read is still James Dyson's first autobiography. It's called Against the Odds because the entire book is just 14 years of struggle. It's James making every single mistake possible that a young entrepreneur can make. It's him persevering and enduring through 5127 failed prototypes. But James realized the same thing when he started building products. He's a great line in that book that describes what Jensen's teaching us at this point in the video's history. And he says people, this is what Dyson said, people do not want all purpose. They want high tech specificity. Another lesson Jensen learned from this. He was embarrassed. The fact of how little he did not know. Again, he is ruthless like the self criticism. He's really ruthless himself. But I think there's a benefit because it's forcing himself to learn. And this is something he's going to apply this public criticism that he's known for in building the video. So he was talking about the fact that one of the first board meetings, you know, this envy one almost killed the company. And yet at the board, one of the board members was asking, he's like, well, how are you going to position this? And this is what Jensen said. He goes, he asked me a simple question and I had no idea how simple it was. And it was impossible for me to answer because I didn't understand it. The answer is supremely deep. You'll spend your whole career answering that question. And again, the issue was that the video's message with the envy one was far too complicated. He didn't put enough thought into how you position it. What's very weird about product positioning is everybody comes up with their own definition of it. I think David Ogilvy's definition that he wrote in like 1965 has not been approved on improved on. I still think it's the best simple way, simple way to think about how to position your product. And so David Ogilvy's definition of product positioning simple. It's what the product does and who is it for? There's a great line that the author take him wrote in this section that I think is beautiful. It says seduction requires a simple message. The marketing and the positioning of the envy one was far too complicated. And also, Tay, I got to thank Tay as well. He sent me a bunch of supplemental material to help me make this podcast. And Tay wrote an absolutely fantastic book because it gives you this insight into the unique mind of Jensen. Jensen does not shy away from how bad he was during this period. He talks about this. Here's another quote from the book on the early days of Nvidia. We were just bad at our jobs. The first five years of our company, we had really talented people working super, super hard. But building a company is a new skill. And that is why the value, the main value I got in the book, he said, we were able to benefit in the fact that Jensen learns he's going to adjust. You'll see in the future is maniacal working habits. He picks up all these ideas about the dangers of complacency, the importance of having a flat, fast organization. He's got a lot of new ideas on how to run Nvidia, and he wouldn't have had them had he not gone through the painful and tumultuous time in the company's early history. So their first two products fail. They got mass layoffs. They're in a cash crunch. It goes back to again, do you want to be great? Well, then I wish you pain and suffering. He's speaking. He's giving advice that had benefited him. And again, I think all this, this, these failures that happen is like you see him developing his endurance. You see him developing his pain tolerance because it's impossible to run a company for 30 years and not confront and endure and overcome adversity and discomfort. It's just not going to happen. So at this point in the company history, Jensen has to lay off. He has to do mass layoffs. He goes down from over 100 employees to down to 40. And Jensen also realizes that Nvidia is not going to be able to raise more money. So in the words of Jeff Bezos, what did it do? They have to invent their way out. They need to create a great product and sell it. The third product they're making is called Revo 128. And since he's running out of money, he realized, hey, we have to shorten the amount of time it usually takes us to build a new product. One way to do that is to actually shorten the testing cycle. So let me read this one book. Jensen heard about a company. I think it's called Ecos, the main machines that enable engineers to run tests on digital chip prototypes, bypassing the need to make an actual chip for testing and thus saving time. But an Ecos machine cost a million dollars and would cut Nvidia's runway from nine months down to six months. But Jensen realized it would speed up the testing process by significantly more time. That saved time actually saved the company because this third product was a success. And then you see that Jensen's has he's a very good salesperson. He's very charismatic. He's got a showmanship to him. And so let me give an example. Once they they they build a Revo 128, he gathers all of the entire company, which not many people left in the company cafeteria. He pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket and he reads off a dollar amount. It is a small dollar amount. And then he folds the paper back, puts in his pocket. He's like, hey, that's how much money we have in the bank. That's not good. The room was like, oh, shit, we're in big, big trouble. And then he pulls out another piece of paper from his pocket. He opens it up and he goes one purchase order from STB Systems for 30000 units of Revo 128. And the entire company erupted in cheers. OK, so I say all that really to say this. This is now this list of 19 reoccurring ideas that I think connect and interplay with each other. And it's really like, again, how Jensen what is Jensen learned on how to run a company and how to build a company after decades and decades of experience and learning and practice and failure and pain. And the very idea number one of the 19 is Jensen as a teacher. So I want to start here because the very first sentence in the book is in another life Jensen might have been a teacher. That, of course, is going to mean a lot to you and I because a common trait of history's great founders is the fact that they spend a lot of their time teaching their organization. So I actually went and talked with Sage about this or prompted Sage about this. And there's a great lot of great examples. So many of the great founders saw themselves primarily as teachers. People like Sol Price, Henry Singleton, Warren Buffett, Bill Walls, Steve Jobs. In fact, Jim Sinegal, the founder of Costco, who was a mentee of Sol Price, has the best quote on this. He says, if you're not as a leader of the company, if you're not spending 90 percent of your time teaching, you're not doing your job. And so one of the ideas that Sage reminded me of that I forgot is that the Sinegal learned that from Sol Price. Sol Price had this idea of what like why are you teaching? What are you actually doing? And he says you actually the best leaders create alter egos through teaching the end result of the leader teaching all their employees to become alter egos. Now you have somebody that can understand and perform their jobs as well as well as are better than the owner or the leader of the company would. This is why I think distilling things down to a list of principles or a handful of maxims is so common and so important because essentially what the leader of the company is doing, what Jensen's doing is you're continuously teaching and reinforcing your company philosophy and the values over time by repeating the principles and the maxims. The great founders essentially become evangelists who relentlessly teach about the company's mission and their values. And in fact, the people that work with Jensen, they call him Professor Professor Jensen and they talk about the fact that he has a very he's a he's really good at explaining complicated concepts in a way that almost anybody can understand. And the way he does is he has a tool for this. Actually, he likes to use his preferred medium for teaching is the whiteboard. And so in the book, it says at many of the meetings that he attends in the video, he will leap up with marker in hand and diagram a problem or sketch an idea. Even if someone else is speaking or whiteboarding themselves at the same time. Okay, so idea number two, NVIDIA is Jensen with 29,000 lives right now. NVIDIA has 29,000 employees. So one of the first sentences or the first sentence in the book is that in another life, Jensen might have been a teacher. One of the last sentences in the book is the most succinct definition of the NVIDIA way is that it's Jensen's way or that it is simply Jensen himself. There's a lot of similarities between Steve Jobs and Jensen and one of the 10 or 15 books I've read about Steve Jobs and Apple. There's a line that's stuck in my brain that I never forgot. And it's talking about how he built Apple. He said he's made and remade Apple in his own image. Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives. What Jensen and Steve Jobs both learned the importance of managing learning how to manage your company as an extension of yourself says everyone at the company shared Jensen singular focus on the mission. Everyone shared his work ethic. Everyone worked as fast as humanly possible in order to keep NVIDIA one step ahead of the competition. He is NVIDIA and the company is Jensen. The way I think about this, there's another note I left myself. You could say, you know, Jensen, NVIDIA is Jensen with 29,000 lives or you can say you need to build an F1 organization because he has a great line about this. He says ultimately my staff, which is his direct reports, which we'll talk about later, is something that I have to know how to work with. The company's organization is like a race car. It has to be a machine that the CEO knows how to drive. Michael Moritz wrote this book called The Little Kingdom, and it is about the first few years of the history of Apple. He updated the book in I think 2009, 2010. That book is called The Return to the Little Kingdom and he wrote a forward. And there's a line in that book where he's describing in the introduction or in the forward, he's describing Steve Jobs I think is very appropriate here. He said founders, at least the very best of them are unstoppable, irrepressible forces of nature. That is certainly true for Jobs. That is certainly true for Jensen. And I think what he said there is very smart. The company's organization is like a race car. It has to be a machine that the CEO knows how to drive. And that's why he has built a company in his image. He has made and remade NVIDIA in his image. So let's go to the third idea. The whiteboard. I already gave you a hint. At NVIDIA, the whiteboard is a primary form of communication and meetings. It is very fascinating how, you know, again, there's no right one right way to do it. It should be right for you. You know, some people like Bezos wants a six page, you know, memo. Jobs wants a demo. Jensen wants the whiteboard. So the whiteboard represents both possibility and ephemerality. I can't pronounce that word. I'm sorry. The belief that a successful idea, no matter how brilliant, must eventually be erased and a new one must take its place. One of the reasons Jensen likes to use the whiteboard as the primary form of communication and meetings says everybody must demonstrate their thought process in real time in front of an audience. The whiteboard. There is no hiding. I lost count how many times in the book they're talking about how central, like how important whiteboarding is to running NVIDIA. And actually, one of the things that take him was gracious to send me. He sent me this this Wall Street Journal, like write up a review of the book written by this guy named Ben Cohen. Ben has some great writing here in terms of like what he learned from reading the book and the importance of of the whiteboard. It says instead of cloistering himself in a private office, Jensen prefers to work from conference rooms. He does his best thinking at the whiteboard, which he uses so frequently that he has a favorite brand of marker that is only sold in Taiwan. And so even when he's traveling, they have to travel with this specific brand of marker and they have to travel with whiteboards. He's going to use this everywhere else. This again, I think explains why this is so important to Jensen. Whiteboarding forces people to be both rigorous and transparent. It requires them to start from scratch every time they step up to the board and therefore lay out their thinking as thoroughly and clearly as possible. It becomes immediately apparent when someone hasn't thought something through at the whiteboard. There is no place to hide. Idea number four flat organizational structure. So Jensen's famous or infamous, the fact that he has 60 direct reports and he refuses to do one on one. So Jensen, I think that one of the main reasons he designed a flat organization is a flat structure fights against the danger of slow decision making. Jeff Bezos has this great thinking about how dangerous making decisions slowly inside an organization could be. This is what Jeff said about this. You can drive great people away by making the speed of decision making really slow. Why would great people say in an organization where they can't get things done, they look around after a while and they say, hey, look, I love the mission, but I can't get my job done because our speed is so slow. This is something that Jensen learned in through trial and error and through failure. He says when we were a small company, we were really bureaucratic and really political. And so as a result of that, Jensen thought about how he create this ideal organization from scratch. And he realized he would choose a much flatter structure so that employees could act with more independence. He also saw that a flat structure would weed out lower performers who were unaccustomed to thinking for themselves and acting without being told what to do. And he just said flat out, I want to create a company that naturally has a flat structure. I want to create a company that naturally attracts amazing people. And so Jensen describes this flat organizational structure. The first layer is the senior people. This is his staff. You would think that they need the least amount of management. He said they know what they're doing. They're experts in their field. He did not want to spend time on career coaching because the majority of them had already reached the pinnacle of their careers. He rarely held one on one meetings with his direct reports. Instead, he focused on providing them collectively with information from across the organization as well as his own strategic guidance. And what I love about this is that he's adamant about running the company based on the best way to do it for him. And he refused this to change his management philosophy. He is insistent on a flat structure. He steadfastly refused to change his management philosophy even when new board members joined and recommended that he hire a chief operating officer to reduce his administrative burden. No, thanks, he replied. This is a great way. Talk about the way he runs the company in this flat organizational structure is a great way to make sure everybody knows what's going on. Really think about what he's doing here. What he's saying. You create a company building philosophy that fits you. It does not matter what other people are doing. What is natural, authentic to you? And what do you and are you going to enjoy doing this so you can do it for a long period of time? Jensen created a company that he could manage directly. There is a vast cultural difference between Nvidia and other companies. Jensen talks again about this. These ideas are, you know, I organized them all like under topic, but they are spread through hundreds of pages in the book. So Jensen repeats again the benefits of keeping his company flat. It turns out by having a lot of direct reports, not having one on ones, we made the company flat. Information travels quickly. Employees are empowered. That algorithm was well conceived. And finally, another benefit, he says you want a company that's as large as necessary to do the job, but as small as possible and not bogged down by over management and process. Number five. And again, this is why I think all of these really, you know, it doesn't really matter what order you take them in. Other than I think number one probably has to be that Jensen's a teacher because he's really teaching his philosophy to the entire organization. But very public criticism is something he's known for. This is probably repeated more than any other idea in the book. And the reason I put this after number four, which is, you know, build a flat, fast organization because it turns out very public criticism works very well if you want a flat, fast organization. So Jensen does not believe, you know, there's this maxim like praise publicly, criticize privately. No, he does not. He criticizes publicly so that the entire organization can learn from a single person's mistake. There's so many examples of the book. There's a lot of parallels to again, Steve Jobs here. I want to read Jensen's words of like why he's doing this. Over the years, I realized that what was happening, how people protect their turf and how they protect their ideas. So he's anti, you know, he does not want bureaucracy to build up into a size company. So I created a much flatter organization. His anecdote to backstabbing to gaming of metrics and to political infighting is public accountability. And if need be public embarrassment, I just say it out loud. I've got no trouble calling people out. So let me give you an example of Jensen's public criticism so that the entire company can learn from an individual's mistake and his constant fight against complacency, which would be another idea that you and I will talk about. Jensen was furious at the poor planning and execution on the chip. He called out its engineers at an all company meeting. Is this the piece of shit you intended to build? He shouted. The architects did a shitty job putting the product together. How could you not see the issue before it happened? Someone should have raised their hand and said we have a design issue here. This is a product they called the NV 30. And so yelling at the people are cursing at them. You know, some people are like, I can't like, can we kind of moderate our language? Can we be a little more kind or more respectful? I was reading this actually notes. It came from it's not even from Johnny Ives biography. It actually comes from an interview Johnny I gave Johnny I gave after Steve Jobs passed. And he talked about one of the best criticism that he ever got from from Steve was the fact that Steve called Johnny Vane. And this is what Johnny said. He goes, I remember asking Steve about this. I could be perceived that his critique of a piece of work was a little harsh, right? Didn't that just sound like what we just the example we just went over with with Johnson seems pretty harsh. It's like calling you a piece of he called what you did a piece of shit. I can't believe he did this. He's screaming. And so Johnny's recounting this conversation with Steve is like, you know, you were kind of harsh with your criticism. We had put a lot of heart and soul into this. And I asked Steve, could we not moderate the things that we said a little? And he said, why? And I said, because I care about the team. And Steve said this brutally brilliant, insightful thing. He said, no, Johnny, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you. I thought you held the work up as the most important, not how you believe you were perceived by others. And Johnny's response was I was terribly cross because I knew he was right. Jensen is not doing this to intentionally hurt people's feelings. He's doing this because he puts the work up as the most important. He is this great line where he says he tortures people's I guess I'm laughing. He tortures people into greatness. So Jensen offers the video employees direct criticism in large meetings so more people can learn from a single mistake. This is what he says. Feedback is learning. For what reason are you the only person who should learn from this? We should all learn from that opportunity. He says that Jensen displays his trademark directness and impatience in all settings. He does this all the time in small meetings, too. He just can't let go. He has to make it punitive a little bit. Again, public criticism is very important to Jensen to repeat it. I don't know, a dozen times over and over again. In fact, I saw it so much. I went up leaving myself the same note over and over again. I go, oh, this is just like Steve Jobs telling Johnny that he's vain, that you're putting people's emotions over the work. Again, Jensen is going to hold up the highest. He's going to hold the work as the quality of the work as the most important. So I don't want to seem like a like a like a crazy obsessed person, even though I definitely am. I play I play the documentary The Last Dance in the background while I work. And the last dance is obviously about Michael Jordan and the final season with the Bulls. And there's actually that was going over the outline and reading the book while this is playing in the background. And there's actually a line in the documentary where one of Jordan's teammates is describing Jordan. And because I was like eyeballs deep in the world of Jensen the past few weeks, at the same time, I'm rewatching the documentary. I was like, oh, this this sounds just like Jensen. So this is this is Jordan's teammate describing Michael. Michael wanted to be the best player on the best team. He's raising his voice. He's calling guys out. He's talking about how he's treating his teammates. He's raising his voice. He's calling guys out. So we're not playing well as a team. We're lazy. He's not worried about hurting your feelings. If he did, you could leave. He would gladly tell you you don't want to play hard. Fine. Get out. And then right after this, Michael is explaining this leadership style and why he played the game the way he did. And I feel like there's an echo of of of Jensen. Jensen is not trying to be like, oh, just, you know, just another founder. He's trying to be the best of the best to create a company that nobody else on the planet could create. And he has done that. And so he's talking about the fact that he's being really harsh on his teammates. He's he's calling out how lazy they are and not not working hard enough, not not practicing enough, not playing well in games. And this is the time when the second best player, Scottie Pippen, was out. And he was really worried because they're losing games. He goes every this is Michael Jordan speaking now. He goes every day that Scottie wasn't playing gave someone else the confidence that they could beat us. And if you're trying to maintain dominance over people, you don't want to give them a chance to gain confidence. So that drove my energy. Let's get this thing rolling. That leads into idea number six, tortured into greatness, this habit of self criticism. So Jensen is not just public publicly criticizing other people. He does this to himself. He has a great line about this where he talks about I want to torture people into greatness, which he realizes he's tortured himself into greatness as well. So I'll talk about this a little bit later on. But Jensen believes that complacency kills and Jensen has this combination. These traits may even seem contradictory, but I would just say that this combination of traits I'm about to describe to you is very common for a lot of history. And as a result of the podcast, I get to meet a lot of world class entrepreneurs today. They listen to the podcast and they have these traits too. So Jensen has this combination of extreme self confidence and charisma matched with this inner voice that says he sucks. An inner voice that says nothing he ever does is good enough. And that inner voice typically is impossible to satisfy. So he tortures his team into greatness, but he tortures himself into greatness as well. And so let me talk about this intense habit of self criticism. This is much later in the video's history. They just they smash this quarter, the financial performance, the products are great. There's like we just blew the doors off this quarter. We're having a meeting with Jensen and figure is we're going to like congratulate ourselves. And he stands up in front of Jensen, stands up in front of the room and he goes. I wake up every morning. I look at myself in the mirror and I say, you suck. And so the person working in a video just could not understand. It's like this guy's why all counts when the most successful people in the world. How could he still think in such terms? And my answer to that by spending eight years and four months and reading three hundred seventy five hours. So of course he does. Of course he does. Jensen has a great line in the book. He says, I don't like giving up on people. I'd rather torture them into greatness. Idea number seven. This is very fascinating. I don't think I've ever heard this idea before. It's Jensen's speed of light idea. So the speed of light idea is the only benchmark that we're going to judge ourselves and how fast we move will be the absolute maximum speed possible. What the hell does that mean? So he wants all of the work done in a video to be contained by only one thing, and that's the law of physics. So the speed of light means that you have to take every single project inside your company. You break it down into its component tasks and then each task must have a target time to completion that assumes no delays, no cues or no downtime. Why? Of course you're going to have some kind of unexpected things pop up because he wants to set the theoretical maximum, which he calls the speed of light. He wants to know what is the physics like the fastest this could be done. And you know, it's the fastest it could be done because it's physically impossible to to exceed that time. And then he says, we're not going to judge ourselves on what we used to do. We're not going to judge ourselves on what other companies do. I don't give a shit what other companies are doing. We are going to judge ourselves against the speed of life. So our speed of life speed of light says Jensen would reprimand subordinates who set goals. I referred to what the company had already done before or what the competitors were doing at that moment. As he saw it, he needed to prevent that kind of eternal rot that he observed at other companies. So I'm going to give you an example of Jensen speed of light idea already gave you a little hint earlier. This is about the Revo 128 to save time. Jensen decreed that Nvidia would have to develop their driver software for the Revo 128 before the prototype chip was completed. This was a reversal of the customary process. This would say shave nearly a year off the production timeline. You have to shave a year off the production timeline because if you remember, he's running he's got nine months of cash. Now he just bought that machine. So he's got six months of cash. There is no time. So says this would shave nearly a year off the production timeline, but it would require the company to find a way to bypass the step of testing the software and physical chips. That's why Nvidia invested a million dollars in that Icos emulator. Even though every dollar was precious, it would allow them to approach the speed of time. Here's another description of the speed of time. The video employees did not think did not let themselves think about what was likely to work or what they could reasonably achieve. They only cared about what would be possible with the maximum amount of effort and minimum amount of wasted time. Idea number eight. Jensen is unapologetically extreme. He's extreme in all things. He works all the hours and he says no one will outwork me. So these ideas I grouped all under idea number eight. So you know I'm obsessed with Edwin Land, founder of Polaroid, Steve Jobs, hero. And there's a great line in one of the many biographies of Edwin Land. I think I've done like five or six podcasts on Edwin Land. So if you haven't listened to them, you should go on the back catalog and definitely listen to as many as possible. Steve was studying Edwin Land when he was 20. Steve was still studying him when he was dying. Just incredible, incredible person. But Edwin Land is, you know, one of one. And there's a great line in one of his biographies. Somebody worked with with Edwin Land. He goes, this man never had an ordinary reaction to anything. Jensen the same way. So there's this hilarious meme and any any guy knows this. Like you walk into a public restaurant, there's a public restroom, there's a series of urinals. It is plight. It is etiquette. If there's a bunch of empty urinals, do not stand next to me. Like give me some space. And so there's this meme you always see where this guy's using urinal. There's like 50 empty urinals and then guy walks into the bathroom and uses the one right next to him. Jensen literally does that. He did that. This guy is so relentless. He will if you work for him, he will grill you at the urinal. I got to read this to you. No place in a video headquarters was safe from a drive by grilling from Jensen. Let me pause there. Actually, I just thought of that this I didn't think about this earlier. There's a line again, another pair of loves jobs. It talks about how intense his focus and like he'll stare at you and he like he should completely focus on you. It's kind of like would scare some of the employees at Apple. And if they found him like an elevator or something, they would like try to skip the elevator because you don't want his attention. I think there was an example where like you get in the elevator by the time you get off, you've lost your job. It seems like folks on what you're doing. You couldn't explain where you're working. I was very upset. So there's there's an element to that with Jensen as well. So Jensen is getting Kenneth Hurley's at a urinal. Jensen walks up and starts using the one next to him. And Hurley goes, I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in the bathroom. And Jensen had other ideas. He goes, hey, what's up? And Hurley replied with not much, which earned him a sidelong glance from Jensen. Hurley panicked, thinking I'm going to get fired because he thinks I'm not doing anything. Hurley proceeded to list 20 things he was working on. OK, Jensen replied, satisfied with the answer. When I first read that, I absolutely lost it. Just heard laughing. Go back to this idea is like no one's going to work me. He's unapologetically ashamed. He says there may be people smarter than me, but no one is ever going to work harder than me. When part of his staff mentioned to Jensen that some employees were griping about the long work hours, Jensen's response was typically direct. People who train for the Olympics grumble about training early in the morning to Jensen was sending a message. Long hours are a necessary prerequisite for excellence. Over and over again, these these these examples of Jensen just being completely unapologetically extreme. There's like some kind of like like award given by a magazine or some kind of like industry publication. And they thought they were happy like, oh, look, we finished second. This is the early days of Nvidia. And Jensen sternly tells them second place is the first loser. Jensen's guidance was direct. Just go win. The idea was whoever could run faster is going to grab all the land. Jensen's unapologetically extreme when he was recruiting. He invites this guy working at he's a chief engineer at Silicon Graphics. He invites him to lunch. He goes, listen, John, you should really think about coming to Nvidia because ultimately I'm going to put SGI out of business. Jensen is completely relentless about work. He says you have to allow yourself to be obsessed with your work. I work every day. There's not a day that goes by that I don't work. If I'm not working, I'm thinking about working. Working is relaxing for me. And so here's an example of how just being unapologetically extreme actually created a lot of value for Nvidia. And some might call this story like how do you work three times as hard and three times as fast as your competitors? But there's just a lot of anecdotes in the book where there's people that used to work in a video. They got used to the culture and then they leave and they go work at other like tech companies. They're like, wait, why is everybody like everybody else is moving like slow motion. There's like way that their culture is a lot less intense. So it's not just to be unapologetically extreme for the sake of being unapologetically extreme or throwing a lot of a lot of like hours at something. It's like doing this. You have an advantage. Other people don't. And so Jensen, this is before the AI boom. The video is just a PC graphics. So just in the PC graphics industry. And he's trying to figure out he's like, OK, like the top of this industry, there's like a lot of turnover. I've gotten to the top. I want to stay here. How do I do that? And one way he does this is by being unapologetically extreme. So he says, if you look at the PC graphic industry, why is it that one company can never hold a lead for more than two years? Now that Nvidia was the market leader, Jensen became obsessed with this problem. He realized the whole industry moved according to the rhythms of the computer manufacturers who refresh their product launches twice a year. Chip makers, Nvidia included, took 18 months to design and launch a new chip and typically only worked on one chip at a time, which means chips were functionally obsolete long before chip makers could come out with a new product. Jensen had figured out how to keep Nvidia ahead of its competition. He said we were going to fundamentally restructure the engineering department to line up with the refresh cycles, which how do you do this? The video would split the design team into three groups. The first would design a new chip architecture, while the other two worked in parallel to the first to develop faster derivatives based on the new chip. What is that? Why? Why would you do that? Because this allows the company to release a new chip every six months. The competitors are releasing a chip every 18 months and he has a line for this. He says this was called three teams, two seasons. Now the company would have three times as many chips on the market. Even if a competitor offered a slightly better product, PC makers would have no motivation to switch away from Nvidia, knowing that a faster part would arrive within six months. Idea number nine. This is one of my favorite ideas. I've never heard this either. It's Jensen's top five email idea. Really, this is just a genius way to get unfiltered information from the entire company. So Jensen asks every employee in the video at all levels that you have to send an email and they're called like T5T. So you need the top five things that you're working on or what you've recently observed in the market. Things like customer pain points, what some competitors doing, any kind of new development in technology, if there's any kind of project delays. And so the ideal top five email is five bullet points where the first word is an action word. And so something like finalize, build, secure. And to make it easier for Jensen to filter these emails, he has each department tag them by the topic and the subject line. So let's say he wants to get all the recent emails on hyperscaler accounts. He can just easily do a keyword search, see all that and then read through all these bullet points. Now, top five emails is a crucial. They are crucial feedback channel for Jensen. And he would tell his employees why he why he the top five emails are so important. He says it's easy to pick up on the strong signals, but I want to intercept them when they are weak, which he winds up doing, which I'll tell you back in one second. But again, I think all these ideas are combined unapologetically extreme top five emails. So he's like, you know, I want to pick up on these weak, these signals when they're weak and then we can develop into something that's strong. But to his staff, he said it this way. Don't take this the wrong way, but you might not have the brainpower or the wherewithal to detect something that I think is pretty significant. So every day he reads over 100 top five emails to get a snapshot at what's happening inside of the company. And so I want to read from that Wall Street Journal article that was written by Ben Cullen that Tay Kim sent me. He says employees have been sending notes known as T5Ts, top five things that they're working on, things they're thinking about or things they're noticing in the corners of the business. And for decades, Jensen has been reading them, all of them. If you send it, Jensen says, I'll read it. Top five thing emails have become his preferred method of flattening hierarchy. Strategy isn't what I say, it's what they do, Jensen said. That's a good line. Strategy isn't what I say, it's what they do. So it's really important that I understand what everybody is doing. He does that by reading top five thing emails. He doesn't want information that has already made its way through layers of management. What he wants is information from the edge. That's a direct quote from Jensen. He says, I want information from the edge. He is looking for the next zero billion dollar market, a frontier that has not been explored because it barely exists. But one day could be a thing. One of the weak signals that he intercepted years ago was a wonky but exciting development in machine learning that kept popping up in T5T emails. Jensen decided that Nvidia needed to invest more in tools for accelerating workloads on its GP use. This is why they're a three trillion dollar company today. That decision clearly paid off. These days, those GPUs are the brains of artificial intelligence. And again, the hilarious part about him being unapologetically extreme, he says this is what he does for fun. He's like, I drink a scotch and I do emails. And the one funny thing, there's an anecdote in the book that's pretty funny, where people hate when Jensen goes on vacation because he emails them more. They're like, what are you supposed to do on vacation? I'm doing emails. I'm like watching my kids play or whatever when they were younger. There's a very intense email culture at they say the email culture in a video is like unrelenting. There's nothing he isn't anything stay or anything fester. If you get an email from him, you need to act on it right away. He does not want anything to fester. And in fact, I finished reading this book quite a while ago and we're working on outline and organizing the ideas for way longer than I normally do. Because I really do think it's you know, he's probably he is one of the most important founders alive right now. And I think there's just a lot of good ideas that you and I can hopefully use in our work too. So I've been like having nonstop conversations with a bunch of my founder friends about this. And I was actually telling a friend about this intense email culture described in the book. And I didn't know that Nvidia invested invested in my friend's company, this company called Together AI. And the company's again, this is just an investment from Nvidia. And he's like, oh, yeah, like he's like that in real life. I go, what do you mean? He goes like he invested in our company and we'll send emails. And the response is super fast. And at the same lunch when we're having lunch, I met a young, young guy, I shouldn't say kid. But a few years ago, he was a kid. He was probably like 19 at the time. And he was working for like some chip company. I can't remember the name, but he heard what we were talking about. He's like, oh, yeah, I emailed Jensen. What do you mean you email Jensen? He's like, well, I was an intern at this chip company. And inside that company, they kept talking about their developing like the Nvidia killer or whatever. And so this intern and another chip company called emails Jensen. And within, you know, a few minutes, Jensen writes back with like his perspective on is there like, is it true what their company saying? Is it possible? Is it a Nvidia killer? But again, he just wants to know what's going on. He wants information from the edge. Idea number 10. This won't come as a surprise. Jensen's communication style, blunt, concise and direct. He says over and over again, he believes in direct, truthful, blunt communication. We're not worried about people's feelings. We're putting the work above everything else. But I just have to read one line that I absolutely loved. Jensen's emails are short and sweet, like a haiku. This is something that even outside of work that he has in common with a lot of history's greatest leaders. Napoleon was the same way. Let me read this this line from this biography Napoleon that I read says long orders, which require much time to prepare to read and to understand are the enemies of speed. Napoleon could issue orders of a few sentences, which clearly express his intentions and required little time to issue and to understand. Winston Churchill during World War II, when he's fighting the Nazis, he would limit the size of the memos that you could write him and he would tell his staff it is slothful not to compress your thoughts. One of my favorite examples of this. What did he just say? Napoleon could issue an order in a few sentences, which is clearly expressed his intentions and only required little time to issue and to understand. If you have not read the book Creative Selection, highly recommend that you do. It's written by a programmer that would demo and work with Steve Jobs. You could also listen to the episode, which is episode 281 called Working with Steve Jobs, which is on that book. Here's a line from the book. It's going to sound just like Jensen. It's going to sound just like Napoleon, just like Churchill. Steve was always easy to understand. He would either approve a demo or he would request to see something different next time. Whenever Steve reviewed a demo, he would often say with highly detailed specificity what he wanted to happen next. He was always trying to ensure the products were as intuitive and straightforward as possible. And he's willing to invest his own time, effort and influence to see that they were. I chuckle to myself over how much time I've spent thinking about this iPad demo and how much Steve taught me in one meeting where he spoke just four sentences. Idea number 11, Lua. Again, all these ideas interact with each other. I think they build upon each other. We just talked about how important being direct, important of having a flat organizational structure and going really fast. So if you start rambling, Jensen will just say Lua. OK, this is a maxim and a shorthand. It's an acronym. It means listen to the question, understand the question, answer the question. So if he says Lua, he wants you to stop and just do those three things in order. Listen to the question, understand the question, answer the question. Number 12. This is so cool. Again, I love there's a bunch of ideas in this book that are truly novel and unique. So number 12, the mission is the boss and pilot in command. I think he really picked up on the fact that as you build an organization over time, as it grows, it starts to exist for the sake of perpetuating itself. And he's like, no, no, no, we want a flat organization. One, like we want to just focus on the mission. But as the mission changes and if you read the book and you obviously clearly like they start on the video game industry, what are they doing now? They're dominating the artificial intelligence industry. Like that is because he had this flat, fast reactive culture and organization and he can switch the mission and then take all the resources onto that new mission. This is what Jensen says. The concept of the mission is the boss makes a lot of sense because ultimately we're here to realize a particular mission, not in service of some organization under the mission is the boss philosophy. Jensen starts every new project by designing a leader. And I love what they call their leader. They call the leader a pilot in command. This pilot in command now is the one accountable for that mission and is directly reports directly to Jensen. He says we have a PIC, a pilot in command for every project. Nobody can hide behind such and such team is working on. No, it's a person. There's a goddamn name attached to it. The pilot in command is accountable. Jensen organized the video's employees into groups centralized by functions, sales, engineering, operations and so on. They're treated as a general pool of talent and not divided by business units or divisions. Why? Because when you have a new mission, you take all these these functions, sales, engineering, operations, whatever, and now you can turn them or point them at a new mission. And now they're under the direction of a pilot in command. And then that pilot in command directly reports to Jensen. Again, I think this is really, really important. I dedicate an entire episode to this. There's episode 360. If you haven't listened to it, it's on Bob Kiernan, the founder of fast and all. He wrote a book that that book has one really one idea that you that the leader's job is to keep everyone inside of the organization working for the company's core objective. That is very natural in human nature to drift and later like no, no, no. Back over here. Back on the company's core objective. One other section from this he gives Jensen gives his employees a high degree of independence over their individual projects, but only if they can keep those projects perfectly aligned with the company's core objectives. After you're done listening to this, if you want, I think you spend an hour really digging into episode 360. The book is almost impossible to find. I had a friend of mine actually write to the company and that's how we were able to get like 20 or 30 copies of the book. I don't know if you can buy it anymore, but episode 360 again, you can summarize that by it's the leader's job to keep everyone working towards the company's core objective. Number 13 is one of my favorite lines in the book. John Johnson Jensen says strategy is not words. Strategy is action. Strategy is not words strategies. Action Jensen said we don't do periodic planning. The reason for that is because the world is a living breathing thing. We just plan continuously. There is no five year plan. Okay. So again, I'm going to read that paragraph and I'm going to filter that paragraph through every other thing that I've read for this podcast and every other thing that you and I've talked about that line. Strategy is not words. Strategy is actions. One of my favorite lines in the book and immediately I think of Henry Singleton. So Henry Singleton had a very distinct philosophy around planning. I did I think one or two episodes on him years ago. I got to redo this. He's too important and I didn't know how to podcast back then. So I got to do another episode on but Charlie Munger, for example, said Henry Singleton was the smartest person he ever met. Okay. Buffett says that it is a crime that business schools don't study Singleton. I think he said you could take the top 100 business school graduates and combine their record and still wouldn't compare to Singleton's record. There's a lot of ideas because I discovered Buffett and Munger before I discovered Singleton that I thought were Buffett and Munger's and they were actually they learned from Singleton because he was building a very secure business. He was building a very successful conglomerate called Teledyne. So I go and I ask Sage for these ideas like how did what did Henry Singleton say about planning and Sage did an excellent job summarizing Singleton's philosophy, which to me sounds a lot like Jensen's philosophy. Number one flexibility over rigid plans. Singleton said I know a lot of people who have very definitive plans they follow assiduously, but we're subject to a great number of outside influences on our business and most of them can't be predicted. So my plan is to stay flexible. Sounds a lot like what Jensen just said. Number two daily steering steering versus long term planning Singleton's approach was summed up in the quote where he says my only plan is to keep coming to work every day. I like to steer the boat each day rather than play plan way ahead into the future. Number three rather than getting caught up in detailed strategic plans Singleton focus on retaining flexibility and keeping options open. He believed excessive planning constrains freedom of action. Number four recognition of complexity, which is exactly what Jensen said. The fact that the world is a living breathing changing thing. Singleton understood that businesses are subject to numerous outside influences that cannot be predicted making detailed long term planning potentially counterproductive. And then this is I think with Jensen would agree with number five independent thinking when others are doing something Singleton was often skeptical. For example late in his career when many companies are doing share repurchases Singleton said if everyone's doing them there must be something wrong with them. And so when Jensen also said hey there's another line that popped up to me he's like we don't have a five year plan. That is exactly the same kind of thinking that Michael Bloomberg used to build his company. In fact in Bloomberg's autobiography this is what he wrote. I never let planning get in the way of doing don't devise a five year plan central planning didn't work for Stalin or Mao and it won't work for an entrepreneur either. Okay idea number 14 choke you with gold. This is a very very old idea. Brad Jacobson his book how to make a few billion dollars talks about the fact that you know between all his companies is like a hundred forty thousand employees just thinking he goes listen money animates people everywhere. You really should overpay for top talent because it's nearly impossible to overpay for top talent and the reason I distilled this down to the maximum choke you with gold. It's because I was reading this old book of David Ogilvy and David Ogilvy talks about this. He says the Medici family persuaded this very famous sculptor in Florence to enter their service where they wrote him a letter which concluded come I will choke you with gold. If you are talented in contributing to Nvidia's mission Jensen would choke you with gold Jensen pours over the stock allocation reports managers can refer an employee for special consideration to senior executives Jensen will review this list of top contributor which they call TC list. Okay Jensen review the list of top contributor candidates and give out special one off grants of stock that vest over a four year period. Once such a grant is approved the employee receives an email from a senior executive with Jensen copied on the email the subject line will say special grants which authorizes the RSU grant in recognition of your extraordinary contributions with a clear description of the rationale behind the award. This is really important thing to about when you do this thing when you when you decide to to grant these Jensen also reaches out into the organization anytime and award stock directly without waiting for an annual compensation review. This allows them to ensure that people who are doing great work feel appreciated in the moment. It is another sign of his interest in every single aspect and every level of his company which leads us to idea number 15 which is a quote from Walt Disney Walt Disney said if we lose the detail we lose it all Jensen is in the details I'm sure people would accuse him of being a micromanager just like they would accuse Walt Disney being micromanager Steve Jobs and so on and so forth. For his entire Jensen is keep in mind Jensen is run Nvidia for over three decades. And the way he's done that is he manages the company directly he involves himself to reap deeply in product decisions sales negotiations investor relations and more he does not work in a private office. He involves himself in everything and Nvidia and so all of these company building philosophies that he has learned and implemented really allow him to get out of the get the most out of the organization that he built and he built that organization in the bet that in the way that makes it the best for him to run. Remember Michael Moritz said on Steve Jobs and the great founders founders at least the very best of them are unstoppable irrepressible forces of nature Walt Disney fall into that category Steve Jobs will fall into that category Jensen falls into that category number 16 idea number 16 complacency kills no looking back no resting on our laurels innovation is a necessity not an option and paranoia. And so there's a line in the book that says Jensen runs the company the way he does because he believes that Nvidia's worst enemy is not the competition but itself the complacency that grips any successful company and this is he applies this to complacency that is both real and imagined remember he is a ruthlessly self critical and blunt about his failures and his mistakes and so you know people are looking at video now it's like one of the best companies ever created. But he it's very fascinating that he doesn't like looking back and when you do look back it says he resists overly positive accounts of the video startup period and his own missteps when we were younger we sucked at a lot of things. The video wasn't a great company on day one we made it great over 31 years it did not come out great you don't build envy one because you're great you don't build envy to because you were great the failure of those nearly killed the company in its infancy. And so he has a great line about this he says we survived ourselves we were our own worst enemy Jensen believes that for the first 15 years when he was CEO's he sucked he says this he actually says it in third person he goes if Jensen meaning himself wasn't even involved in the first 15 years of the company I would really like that he was not proud how he managed the company and he says I don't love talking about our past but. I don't want to like I think this is an important thing too it's like yeah he doesn't love talking about his past he's not just talking about his past failures he applies that even after a massive success remember that one story when they're smashing the quarter and he tells his team that he woke up that morning and wakes up most morning mornings looks at himself in the mirror and is like you suck and I actually think there's a very productive way to do this so this idea of not looking back not resting on your laurels again this is something he has common with Steve Jobs he's not a very productive person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good person he's not a very good and he has a great way I think summarizes what Jensen's doing here not resting on his laurels not like he I think later on the book Jensen says something like you know wasting there's nothing worse than like looking back at your own accomplishments or just not good use of your time and so what Steve says is I say he says I think if you do something it turns out pretty good then you should go do something else that's wonderful and not dwell on it for too long just figure out what's next the reason I think this is important that that it also fits into like Steve Jobs overall philosophy if you go back and ask if Steve was asked one time like what his favorite quote is and it was actually a quote by Aristotle where it says we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit and so I think Steve would tell you the key is keep pushing forward stay hungry and continuing continue to create really wonderful things rather than then dwelling on past achievements and so that this book is this this theme just reoccurs over again that complacency kills I went back and searched all my notes and highlights and you just see this over and over again Andy Grove he had this mantra success breeds complacency complacency breeds failure only the paranoid survive Herb Keller the founder of Southwest said a company is never more vulnerable to complacency than when it's at the height of its success we must not let success breed complacency cockiness greediness laziness indifference preoccupation with bureaucracy hierarchy or obliviousness to threats posed by the outside world there's a great line from one of the biographies of Bernard Arnault founder of LVMH that I read he abhors complacency so much less Schwab who's one of Charlie Munger's favorite founders he said we must constantly remind ourselves as to why we are successful and what we must do to continue to be successful because if we become complacent brother it's all over with Warren Buffett you need to fight off the ABCs of business decay arrogance bureaucracy and complacency when these corporate cancers metastasize even the strongest of companies falter and so that combines with the fact that at Nvidia innovation is a necessity it's not an option and so really think about this is really how you avoid the innovators dilemma so one of Jensen's favorite favorite books is the innovators dilemma one of the main takeaways he took from reading the book is that the threat is actually going to come from the low end of the market and I actually love what he did here so number one the threat comes from the low end of the market number two ship the whole cow and this is gonna be fascinating so this is Jensen talking about how to avoid the innovators dilemma the innovation is a necessity it's not an option for them in a video he says we build Ferraris all of our chips were designed for the high end the best performance the best triangle rate the best polygons I don't want to let someone come in and be the price leaders and lock me out of the bottom and climb their way to the top so he said that that theme reappears throughout history obviously Clayton Christian talks a lot about that in the innovators dilemma Jensen saw that a video could stop throwing away parts the failed quality test this is fascinating ship the whole cow is his idea here okay we're building Ferraris our chips are the best of the best the best best performance really high prices fat margins right so what if I wanted to attack myself what would I do and then I'll just go do that before somebody else does it to me right so Jensen saw the Nvidia could stop throwing away parts the failed quality tests they failed quality test if you're building a Ferrari but not if you're building you know afford fusion right so true these parts were not suitable for the company's Ferrari grade ships but if they were otherwise functional lower speeds Nvidia could repackage them into a late less capable and therefore cheaper version of the company's mainline products this looked like a clear opportunity to make something out of nothing rejected parts were generating no revenue for Nvidia they were thrown out think about how many different products by products that Rockefeller made from materials that were waste waste materials from the refining of kerosene that he went turning turning into products and these massive profitable product lines that again he was just throwing in the garbage now he's like no we need to find uses for our waste materials and package them up as and sell our byproducts exact same thing that Jensen is doing here if it could create a whole new derivative product line that could turn a profit without the expense of time and consuming process of research and development this line would serve as a defense against competitors for whom the low cost chip was their main product Nvidia could easily afford to price this chip down so much that a competitors would be forced to sell at a loss this strategy was dubbed ship the whole cow a reference to how butchers find ways to use almost every part of the carcass not just the prime cuts idea number 17 Jensen goes to school on everybody already mentioned earlier this is somebody this is this idea going school and everybody was described in one of the biographies I read about a young Jeff Bezos said he went to school on everybody obviously before he founded Amazon and during and after but Jensen as exact same you know tendency same idea so this is conference on neural information processing systems such an academic conference where all the machine learning and neuroscience experts present their latest findings and so there's an actual video employee who's there and he runs into Jensen unexpectedly is like Jensen like what are you doing here you're not you're not you're not scheduled to speak to speak what you doing conference and Jensen told him I'm here to learn and what he noticed was that Jensen was sitting towards the front row and it's not like he hired somebody take notes on he's sitting there taking notes showing up himself and trying to observe absorb all the recent developments in artificial intelligence because again goes back to Jensen wanting to be involved in every aspect of new video such an outsource things he's trying to be in the details Jensen also talks about the fact that you know at conferences like this he meets a lot of smart people winds up recruiting and they become employees and assets of new video so this again I think is a reoccurring theme the importance of going to school and everybody there's this guy named Mitch rails Mitch rails co-founder of this company called Dana here Mitch rails goes to school and everybody Dana here is like a hundred seventy billion dollar company today and a friend of mine was just at the small intimate conference with Mitch recently and he was blown away by how focused Mitch was and the entire time Mitch was you know sitting towards the front listening to speakers and he was taking pages and pages of notes and my friend had this thought where he's like I don't get this Mitch you're more successful than anybody else here why are you taking notes and when my friend told me this story I go no wrong answer so there's a great line in Bill Walsh's book score takes care of itself and he says champions behave like champions before they're champions I guarantee you Mitch rails did not build a hundred seventy billion dollar company and then start taking notes he was going to school and everybody and taking notes and learning from every single experience way before he builds a hundred seventy billion dollar company way before he is quote unquote the most successful person in the room because this goes back to the David Olavi said the good ones no more there's another example of Jensen being one of the good ones that no more Jensen shows up to this party at Nvidia it's a party for new hires introduced this guy named Peter Young Jensen already knew who he was he says you're Peter Young you've been here for a year from Sony PlayStation and then you worked at 3dfx prior to that Jensen had similar recall of all the biographical details of the other 50 attendees of that party okay idea number 18 create markets don't do anything someone else can do don't do anything someone else can do is the motto of Edmund land but what Jensen was setting out to do he really believed he was building a company that was unlike any other company and he knew he didn't want to build an undifferentiated commodity product he wanted some kind of pricing power and so it says Nvidia doesn't believe in building commodity products because commodities are subject to downward pricing pressure as competition increases Jensen has always said that we should be doing things that other people cannot that is exactly what Edmund land said we need to bring unique value to the marketplace and you do that by doing work that's cutting edge that's revolutionary work that no one else can do we do not this is really the punch line we don't have a culture of going after market share we would rather create the market okay so all of these ideas leads us up to the final idea idea number 18 is swarm your greatest opportunity and the reason this one is last is because it's going to describe the massive historical opportunity that Nvidia has pursued in artificial intelligence and it's obvious when you read the book that all the things that you and I just talked about enabled and helped Nvidia sees what is going to be likely the greatest at one of the greatest opportunities that humanity has ever had many has ever seen and a single company has been able to especially corner the market and and re most of the profits so far so this is going to what the wild thing here and this is going to be probably the longest section is the fact that this this played out over you know multiple decades Jensen is going to recognize the AI trend very early he's going to invest heavily you know when other people are telling him not to do this and he's going to by doing so he's going to maneuver his company into position to take advantage of it better than any anybody else in the world so you know read a couple highlights we're just going to go through obviously this is what mainly the book is about but I'm going to give you what I feel like the the basic framework of important actions I think that that Jensen did and so there's an idea that reoccurs throughout these these books and said yeah you have to stay in the game long enough to get lucky so the idea that's going to turn the video into a multi trillion dollar company actually came from their customers coming up with unique ways to use their product so the first reference to using the video GPUs for non graphical purposes was in a 2002 research paper on using computers to simulate the movement of clouds you could think of these like really weak signals that that that Jensen was referencing earlier so says an increasing number of computer science researchers using GPUs for non graphics applications researchers who ran their simulations on computers with GPUs reported significant speed improvements over computers that relied on CPU power only these simulations require computers to learn how to reframe non graphics computations in terms that graphical functions are in terms of graphical functions that a GPU could perform in other words the researchers had hacked NVIDIA's GPUs now Jensen's response here was brilliant he sees this way right this unexpected opportunity as a way to expand the market for his products and he's interested in making it easier for other people to do that so what does he do number one he hires the guy who discovered how to do this number two he picks a mission he wants to make it easier for people like the guy who discovered this to find more non graphical applications of GPUs why because anytime you make something easier for people to do that will expand the market and so this guy his name is Harris Harris is the guy that coins the phrase GP GPU which means general purpose computing on GPUs which he's describing this phenomenon that he is witnessing now this is why Jensen saying you know I want direct unfiltered information on information from the edge Jensen quickly grass that GP GPU had the potential to open up the markets for NVIDIA's GPUs way beyond their existing market which was just computer graphics and so Jensen's next thought is well how do I make this easier the way I make this easier I want to generate more demand I need to make it easier to program these GPUs so he could they create this new programming model for chips that they call the compute unified device architecture it's called CUDA CUDA makes it possible and easier for scientists and engineers to leverage the GPUs computing power now keep in mind we're like a decade and a half before all this this huge AI explosion because the reason that's important because Jensen believed that this could expand the videos reach into every corner of the tech industry and the next section is why number nineteen ninety number nineteen swarm your greatest opportunity so this is happening in two thousand eight two thousand two thousand seven two thousand eight is where we are so the error of the GPU would create so many opportunities that Jensen saw as his mission to prepare NVIDIA to take advantage of it even if no one could know exactly what those opportunities would be everything else was secondary so again this is one of the most mind blowing parts of the book for me because it's two thousand seven two thousand eight Jensen's decision to go all in on this is literally going to create trillions of value for the company in the coming decades it's a crazy amount of foresight on his part and it's also going to require him to endure even more pain so Jensen's way to do things is like I'm going to push this everywhere I want to make what I'm doing a foundational technology and if Jensen has conviction for that this is going to work he's willing to invest heavily for the long term even when other people and the market are telling him not to do that so let me just read the section that will make a lot more sense Jensen understood the importance of saturating the marketing with the market with it the more people who had kuda in their hands the faster the technology would establish itself as a standard we should push this everywhere we need to make it a foundational technology Jensen told the kuda team the move was extremely expensive it took four years and the company invested so much in converting its GPUs for kuda compatibility that its gross margin fell from 45 percent to 35 percent as Nvidia increased spending on kuda the global financial crisis destroyed consumer demand and Nvidia's stock price fell by more than 80 percent from october 2007 to november 2008 Jensen believes so strongly in kuda's market potential that he remained committed to the course he had chosen even as his investors demanded a strategic course correction I believe in kuda Jensen said we were convinced that accelerated computing would solve problems that normal computers couldn't we had to make that sacrifice I had a deep belief in its potential and then the video does something really smart here this is something there's been a couple examples of throughout history of the importance of doing so when you're doing something brand new you have to make a commitment to spend a lot of time and energy and resources into educating the market about this new invention so Intel did this when they invented the microprocessor in fact they knew they were on to the biggest they swarmed their greatest opportunity it was very confusing to the market very in some cases scary to the market so they they wind up sending all the founders and the the the the all the like the executives inside of Intel including their founders spent the majority of their time educating the market and running classes in fact what Nvidia does here it sounds a lot like what Intel did when they invented the microprocessor so developers don't know what to do with kuda that's fine the video is going to teach them we are going to educate the market so the videos chief scientist is getting David Kirk begins offering and sending colleges and universities kuda capable machines if they committed to teaching a class on the subject David Kirk ones of visiting universities he would start educating students professors and department heads on all on all the changes on how they were teaching computer science because parallel computing was going to become far more important David Kirk gave over a hundred talks over the course of a year on this he winds up teaching a class himself at the University of Illinois on the subject Nvidia took it upon themselves to go over and spread the religion of GPU computing before it could it really took off in fact this was a necessary step for it to take off there was no textbook on this so Kirk decides to write one is always like this book this foundational book it's hilarious if you're trying to get a movement going I think one step is to write a book on this so Kirk rates the textbook on this that textbook sells tens of thousands of copies winds up getting translated into all these different languages and winds up being used by hundreds of schools to teach thousands maybe tens of thousands of students again the idea is that we need to educate the market in addition to doing this universities they would host the business development and marketing people in a video would host summits they'd have like these two days technology summits at Nvidia where researchers and computer scientists scientists and engineers could come and talk about like how they're using CUDA and the GPUs and so dozens of researchers from life science industry chemical engineers biologists pharmacologists software developers would would attend and then Jensen would show up and he would sit down and get feedback with the real world users of CUDA and then use the insights that he learned from them to inform the development of the product and so again this is where now now we're in 2012 2013 and Jensen just realizes oh my god this is gonna want to be the biggest opportunities in history we are going to this opportunity of GPU powered deep learning is going to be massive and we need to go all in and so let me read this part from the book for me there was considerable debate within the executive team on this topic several Jensen's key lieutenants were against investing more in deep learning in the belief that it was just a passing fad but Jensen overruled them deep learning is going to be really big he said he said this in 2013 we are going all in on it so if you think about everything that you and I have been talking about and highlighting and studying has led up to this Jensen build a company in the image of his own focused yet far-ranging mind now he would pull every lever at his disposal at his disposal to navigate Nvidia to the very center of the tech industry as the company whose hardware could bring about the AI powered future it was definitely not a single day when the entire company changed forever it was a period of several months where Jensen was increasingly interested and started asking increasingly deep questions and then started encouraging the company to swarm to machine learning Jensen announced a change in strategic focus in a company all hands meeting we need to consider this work as our highest priority AI was going to be more important than anything else that could possibly be doing again incredible incredible insight and foresight rather on Jensen's part he believed this is going to be the cause and you know now 10 years later is obviously true obviously accurate it was going to be the largest TAM expansion within a decade Jensen was sure that AI would create the largest total adjustable market expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in decades and so the book does a great job of describing how the interplay of all these ideas the decisions that Jensen and everybody in the video made over a course of three decades allowed them to build this very formidable moat and I thought it was very fascinating that Jensen actually doesn't like the term moat he prefers what he's really trying to build and what he has built is a strong self reinforcing network and there's a great description of the strong self reinforcing network this moat that NVIDIA has built since it's hard to describe NVIDIA's action as anything other than the construction of a competitive moat NVIDIA made a general purpose GPU that represented the first major leap forward in computational acceleration since the invention of the CPU the GPU's programmable layer CUDA was easy to use and opened up a wide range of functions across scientific technical and industrial sectors as more people learned CUDA the demand for GPUs increase Jensen's strategic brilliance ensured that competitors would have difficulty breaking into a market that NVIDIA had created and I think the best way to close is a reminder that the most succinct definition of the NVIDIA way is that it is Jensen's way or it is simply Jensen himself and that is where I'll leave it for the full story highly highly highly recommend it's a no-brainer reading the book everyone I know that's read the book so far has loved it I know a bunch of people have bought multiple copies for their team if you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes available on your podcast player are available at FoundersPodcast.com you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time that is 376 books down 1000 to go and I'll talk to you again soon okay so I have a big update for you for Founders Notes I am eight years into this podcast by the end of the year I will have read well over 400 biographies and autobiographies of some official history's greatest founders I'm doing this because my organizing principle my life's work is I want to organize and distill the collective knowledge of history's greatest founders and I want to do that better than anybody else on the planet why work on the podcast seven days a week so as you can imagine eight years into this 375 different 36 different books it's impossible for me to remember recall everything that I've read so I built a tool that allows me to recall and tap into this collective knowledge of history's greatest founders on demand anytime I want and I use this tool every day and it's a tool that I've been telling you about for the past year it's called Founders Notes you can subscribe and access the tool that I built and the one that I use this is very important what you see when you subscribe that is the same version that I use I don't have a different version it's the exact same thing that you can use so the big update that I have for you is that I've been working with the team at read wise the founders read wise and the team read wise are the ones that have helped me actually build and design this tool so for the past few months we've been working on this major redesign of founders notes and that redesign is done and it's available now I need to give you the prehistory just like I spent a bunch of time in this video episode in this Jensen episode talking about the importance of the prehistory of what was going on before we got to the 19. The 19 key ideas I want to talk about so the prehistory of this project is that for the past six years I've been using this app called read wise to store all of my notes and highlights for every book that I've read the podcast that gives me the ability to search it and pull it up anytime I want it okay and the reason I partnered with read wise last year was because a bunch of people listen to the podcast kept saying hey because I would talk about read wise I talked about the app I talked about how valuable was and the fact that I just like it was very helpful and useful to be able to recall and pull everything up and I didn't do it with ever thinking I was going to build a tool around this but so many people were asking is like hey is there a way I can actually like read all of your notes and so we built a tool called founders notes and allows you to do that you can still do that you can still read all my notes all my highlights and I keep adding to them every week and I will always do so but over time what I realized because I use this tool every day is like the AI assistant called Sage that sits inside of founders notes is actually the most valuable feature and there's a line in the book that I didn't talk about the podcast fits in the book where Jensen's talking about like what we can expect in this AI enabled world that we all live in right now and he says you'll be able to have a virtual assistant almost like a brilliant intern with near perfect memory capable of instantly recalling any piece of knowledge stored on computers and the internet. Sage is this but for the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs so how I use it is like when I asked Sage a question it reads all of my notes all of my highlights all of my transcripts and then provides a concise summary and answer to the information I'm looking for so it and the key here is its memory is way better than mine in fact this is why I think you should subscribe and use Sage as a way to supplement the decisions that you make in your work you just heard me do this multiple times in the episode so think about when Jensen was struggling with figuring out what product positioning is the definition that I recalled was just me asking what is product positioning summarizes the best definition gives us examples for every single thing we talk on the podcast when we talked about how the importance of educating a market when you're creating a new technology or a new product like Intel did what I was reading you came directly from Sage when I talked about how Henry Singleton said what did Henry Singleton say about planning that five point I think was five point bullet list that came directly from Sage when talked about the importance of what's the leaders job as you think of yourself as a leader think of yourself as teachers all the examples from soul price from Henry Singleton from Warren Buffett from Bill Walsh from Steve Jobs that came from Sage and so the big update is now when you log in to founders notes it looks completely different if you have you haven't used it a while or if you've never used it the very first thing you see is the ability to ask Sage a question the other update that was really important to me was we added the ability to toggle between AI models so we built a thing on chat GPT and you can still use that if you want but the default now is Claude 3.5 sona because that's the one I use and it's it's spooky because when I asked a question it sounds like me except with a much better memory again you can talk between whichever one you want and you'll find the one that actually you you feel is most helpful but that's the one I've been using another cool thing that we added as well when you log in you see all these like suggested questions okay all of the suggested questions that you see when you log in these are questions that I have asked Sage and I'm continuing to add to that list of suggested questions because as I keep searching and finding good questions and good answers I added to the suggested prompts or the suggested questions list so even if you didn't have a question you wanted to ask it you could log in see what I've been asking it and actually read and learn from that but again I think the main purpose is like to use it as you have any questions in your business you should be asking Sage because then what happens is essentially like if you could prompt all of history's greatest entrepreneurs to help you solve the problem that you're dealing with inside of your business I'm going to continue get it making it improving it continuing adding to it because again this is a tool for myself I literally cannot make the podcast without it I'm constantly adding to it just as a as a byproduct of natural byproduct of the work that I do it so every single book every single podcast every single transcript every single note and just keep adding to it so if you want to weigh to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand and use it to supplement the decisions that you're making in your work highly recommend you go to foundersnotes.com that is founders with an S founders notes just with an S just like the podcast foundersnotes.com and sign up today thank you very much for the extra support thank you for listening and I'll talk to you again soon
