--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I'm about to do something that I've never done before. I've been working on this podcast for over six years, read over 300 biographies of history's greatest entrepreneurs, well over 100,000 pages. And in that entire time, you have never heard another voice on this feed besides my own. But I want to make sure you don't miss this conversation with David and Ben from the acquired podcast. So right after my dinner with Charlie Munger, I flew directly from Los Angeles to San Francisco because David and Ben very graciously invited to be a guest on their world class podcast. What you're about to hear is a three hour long conversation between three people that are so obsessed with studying the history of entrepreneurship that they're dedicating, it's their life's work. They're dedicating almost every waking hour to do so, to finding great ideas from the past and then sharing those ideas on our podcasts so future generations of entrepreneurs, founders, and investors can benefit. And as you already know, I've been obsessed with David Olgovey ever since I was reading Warren Buffett's shareholder letters. And Warren Buffett said that David Olgovey was a genius. I then went and found every single book that he ever wrote or was written about him and read it. And there's a line in one of the biographies of David Olgovey that says, David Olgovey was building his first class business in a first class way. Ben and David of acquired are doing the exact same thing. I believe that acquired and founders are perfect complements to one another. I focus on the founder, the actual individual, and the person through biographies. They do these hours long, really in-depth company histories that are just absolutely excellent. If you do not already follow acquired in your favorite podcast player, please do so right now and start with their episode on the history of LVMH. It is one of the best episodes that I've ever heard. And I've been obsessed with podcasts for over 13 years now. I would listen to that episode first, but their episode on Walmart is excellent. Their three-part series on Berkshire Hathaway, excellent. Their episode on the NFL, Sequoia Capital, Benchmark, Amazon, the list goes on and on and on. And regardless of what episode that you choose to listen to, what acquired and founders has in common is the fact that we both do an insane amount of research, and we do this so that when you press play, you're guaranteed a good return on the time invested listening to every episode. And one more thing I want to tell you about before we jump into this conversation is the presenting sponsor of this episode is Tiny. Tiny is the easiest way for you to sell your business. They provide straightforward cash exits for founders, and they can do deals of all sizes. In the past, they've bought businesses for as little as a million dollars, and some businesses for well over $100 million. And as we've learned over the last two episodes, Bernard Arnall is the buyer of choice for family luxury businesses. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the buyer of choice for family businesses of all types. And Tiny is well on their way to being the buyer of choice for founders of businesses worth anywhere from a million to over $100 million who want a hassle-free cash exit. If you have a business that you want to sell now or in the future, make sure you email hi at tiny.com first. I hope you enjoyed this conversation, and I hope you follow acquired in your podcast player like I do. So David, do you want to tell us who you had dinner with the other night? I had a three hour dinner with Charlie Munger. That is awesome. Where I could ask him any questions that you want. Well, first of all, I guess we should back up. It's like, there's a reason that he's so admired, right, by so many people, but for me particularly, you get to meet a lot of really interesting people because of the work that we do, right? And so that's like a blessing and something that I know we've had conversations in the past that we deeply appreciate. But Charlie's a different level for me. I literally think of him like the wise grandfather I never had. I've met all kinds of people. I don't really get nervous or starstruck. I was legitimately shaking the day before. I was like, I cannot believe. I didn't want to tell that many people because there's no way this is gonna happen. I won't believe it till it actually happens. We do very similar work, right? And then the other thing where it's just like, how many people have spent six, seven years, tens of thousands of hours reading hundreds of books about the history of entrepreneurship and investing and then not only reading it, taking notes on it, making a podcast. It's us and Charlie and Warren. Yeah, and so the reason I bring that up is because you think about all the different companies and founders you guys have studied, all the different companies and founders that I've studied, right, and like even amongst the rarest group of people, Charlie still stands out. And the crazy thing is, he's 99, right? I get there and we start off in his library, which is like the best place for me that you could possibly see. Set the stage more. How big is the library? How many books are we talking about? So it's not, one of his family members was there too and she's like, oh, this is like nothing. This is like the front room. Wait till you see the back. It's similar to the room we're in, very similar size and floor to ceiling shelves. And so I'm with a small group of friends. In fact, mutual friends for ours. So the people that set this up for us or for me was Andrew Wilkinson and Chris from the founders of Tiny, who are mutual friends. And so we're sitting there and there's actually a funny thing where it starts off and they know both Warren and Charlie. They've talked to him before. So they go right into it and then like I'm sitting there and I had this whole list of probably like 25 questions. I was gonna ask if you like prepared in advance. I know you did. I never got the chance to open my phone because I was just sitting there. I'm looking at him and he's very close. Like maybe a little bit further from me. That was super disrespectful to like take out my phone. That too and I had read every single book on Charlie. I watched all of his videos. Like I've studied this guy forever. And so every time he had said, hey, read this book, I go and read the book. And then I see a bunch of the books that he has recommended behind him. So people are like, oh, was he as like you expected? Like they say, hey, be careful, don't meet your heroes. Right? And he was unbelievably gracious. You know, unbelievable. Like I was like, hey, Charlie, you mind if I take a look at your bookshelf? Right? He's just like, do whatever you want. Just unbelievably polite, still like biting intellect, ferocious intelligence. At 99. At 99. So we were talking earlier downstairs where the scary thing about Charlie is, I remember asking a question about Henry Kaiser, this guy that was super famous when Charlie was younger. He built like a hundred companies, built the Hoover Dam. He was as famous in his time as like Elon Musk is today. Right? But no one knows who he is. And I was asking questions about Charlie in the book and his recall is just insane. So the point we're asking, I go, how do you know all this, Charlie? He goes, I knew his partner. And then he starts telling stories about being, knowing, like having a relationship with Henry Kaiser's business partner. And then all these three hours of just unbelievable stories. And then I go, Charlie, like, how do you remember all this stuff? Like, do you write, like, do you take notes? Do you reread the books over and over again? He's like, nope. And all I could think of was like, imagine. Wow. That guy's mind in 99 is still so sharp. I had brought a gift for him because he talks about like Rockefeller all the time. I bought him this special edition, Centennial edition version of Henry Flagler's biography. Oh, Flagler, yes. So I live in Miami. The guy, Les Sandiford, I think is the author of that book. He is good friends with, there's only like one local bookshop in Miami called Books of Books. And so Les is a local author who's good friends with the owner of that bookstore. So they did a, you can't get this book anywhere else. It's a special edition book. Because Flagler moved to Florida later in life, right? After the Standard Oil thing, yeah. He's got a fascinating story when you talk about that where he, unbelievably wealthy because of Standard Oil. He's, you know, 50, 60, 70 years old when he's doing this. And he's just like, oh, what am I doing now? I'll build an entire state. When he gets to Miami, Miami is little less than 500 people living in a swamp. He just can't live there. There was no AC at the time. And so then he builds the world's first railroad over connecting the Florida Keys. He just essentially, like, you read that book and you're like, oh, humans have no limits other than the ones we put on ourselves. And so that's what Flagler does. He just stretches it. And he does some terrible things too, where it's like, yeah, wanted to find a way to divorce his wife. So he literally moves to another state because he couldn't be divorced in New York, bribes the government of Florida. They create the Flagler Law, which allows him to get a divorce. Then he does that like a few things a few times. I think he's like in the 70s, he marries like a 30 year old. Like, it's not all good. But that guy's like, oh, your rules don't apply to me. Like, I will build whatever I want. He built infrastructure, hotels, everything else. This is like one of the things that I keep learning from Founders Podcast. And I'm curious if you do it intentionally or if you like try not to do it, but like every single time I'm like, oh, people aren't perfect. Like none of your heroes are perfect. And do you find yourself like, because we run into stuff on acquired a lot where like, it's not as fun to tell stories about terrible people. And so you like don't want to show someone's negative side as much because it doesn't, like it's just- Well, we like, we fall in love with them too when we're doing that. Right, and you're like, wow, they're the most extraordinary person on this one axis to ever live. And we should talk about how they're a flawed person in many ways, but it's not fun to dwell on. Like you kind of want to like move through that and be like, yep, yep, they were flawed. Here's the next amazing thing that they did. Like, how do you handle that? Like, you know how a normal biography is written, right? It's like way too much family history. Like I want to know some family history. I don't want five generations back. Stop, like I don't want to know the origination of their last name. I don't need that. I want to know like- And you're like the most qualified person in the world to critique a biography writing style at this point. So why we're reading it is like, everyone wants to know the climb, right? It's like, how did you, you guys, I just went through your entire, to get part of the prepped for Charlie and I was listening to all of your Berkshire episodes, right? Where you guys do a fantastic job on this. Cause like the first two is like the young Charlie, the young Warren. So I would literally, and I've done this forever. It's like, I don't, when you take a Warren Buffett or Ben Franklin or George Washington or anybody that's super famous, when we see them, it's like, oh, who's the Ben Franklin on the a hundred dollar bill? Right? Or who's Washington on the dollar bill? Or who's Buffett at the meeting in Omaha? It's like, no, no, that's the guy that is enjoying the fruits of the person that actually built the empire. That's the soul of it, yeah. I go and stare at pictures like a freak at like of young Charlie Munger when he was like 38 or young Warren Buffett, right? They were like, oh, they were young people once. In our Berkshire series, the first, did we end the first episode without even getting to Berkshire yet? I think we might. You have to. It was the partnership. You mentioned on the Walmart episode where it's like, everybody says, oh, Sam Walton didn't start Walmart, he's 44. Yeah, but he was doing 25 years of practice and learning. And he wasn't just sitting on his ass. Starting a bunch of stuff that looked an awful lot like Walmart. Learning from that. And so the- Which is totally, I mean, aside, but we have no agenda here. That is like, I think both an advantage that we have, all three of us, and kind of a secret that we have, which is that we did Walmart because we wanted to do Amazon. And so we were like, how do we do Amazon, right? We gotta do Walmart first. People want this. This is the right way to study things. I'm glad you brought that up because I think this is why people get a lot of value. And I don't want it to make us about, hey, this is an acquired founder show. The reason that some of the people in our audiences are the most successful people in the world. They're all reading biographies. They're all studying the history of business. I told you guys a few weeks ago, I was very lucky to have a two hour one-on-one lunch with Sam Zell that I didn't think was possible. What I realized in that conversation is like, you don't make, you don't, Sam Zell sold his company for almost $40 billion, right? $38 billion, whatever it was. It's like, you don't build a company, sell for $40 billion, and then learn all this. It's like he was doing this since he was young. We were talking in his autobiography. I think my favorite episode of your podcast is the Kobe Bryant episode. Because this is what these guys are doing. They're like Kobe Bryant. They're watching game tape. They're watching game tape. They're working on the fundamentals from the time they're 12 through the time they die. They don't stop. I think that's what listening to acquired and founders is, is you're watching game tape of history's greatest entrepreneurs. Sam did this when he was younger, but this ties together where Bill Gurley had a fantastic quote about this, a tweet about this, when all that crypto was going crazy and the run-up and people were getting rich. And he's like, one thing I don't like, and I'm paraphrasing because I wasn't expecting to talk about this. He's like, I don't like the younger people denigrating the people that came before them. And he made the point that none of history's greatest entrepreneurs and investors did that. They had the opposite perspective. All of them had idols. You just made the point. You can't understand Jeff Bezos until you study Sam Walton. You can't understand Sam Walton until you understand J.C. Penney and Sol Price and all these guys. Contemporaries, like the point that Walton always made was, I don't think my competitors are stupid. I wanna go shop my competitors and get all of their very best insights and then bring them into my store. Yeah, 100%, they're learning machines. Yeah. And so you get to Charlie's going, tying this all back to this, you get to Charlie's bookshelf and it's just, biographies I've never even heard of. And I do this for a living. I do for a living. I was like, what is this book? And then I started looking, I was like, oh, I'm just taking picture after picture after picture. I was like, I'm ordering every single one. So we're talking about this idea that like, that the way to get truth is to weave together the tapestry of all of history's stories of things that are adjacent to understand like how this opportunity to start some business came to be. And you always have to, like all history is revisionist and all history is biased. And so I think one of the hardest things about making an acquired episode is figuring out like, when we're looking at a source, like someone giving an industry talk who works at a company or like a biographer who chose to dedicate, two years of their life to writing this book after working at Newsweek and covering the sector forever, is like trying to mentally account for and discount from whatever bias and perspective they're coming in with to create whatever the source material is that we're using to then incorporate into our version of, here's how this thing happened. Which is, that's like, I think it's the hardest part about what we do. And I'm curious if you ever think about that. I think about it all the time, because people are like, oh, like survivorship bias or revisionist history and everything else. It's like, here's the problem. We humans don't see things as they are. We see them as we are. So like we could have this super long conversation between the three of us right now, then go into the other room and write down, what just occurred. And every single version is going to be different because it's viewed through all of our experience, the way we think, the words we use. And so what I'm looking at is like, when I'm reading about Sam Walton, right? It's just like, the story we both hit on all the podcasts, because I've done a bunch of podcasts on Sam too, where it's like, the guy's pissed off, he's just like driving him to store to store and he's like, mountain roads taking forever. So he buys the plane and he realizes like, oh, this is a massive advantage because I'm doing something my competitors aren't, right? I'm flying over and you guys mentioned it too, which I thought was hilarious. And then he just lands and he's like, who owns that? Let me land and then he buys for action. So he's like, we're going to negotiate right now. I want to buy it from you. And so my point is like, okay, yes, that most likely occurred, but what is the idea behind that? It's due, you can have an advantage by doing something your competitors are not doing, right? And it just ties together what you just said, is like they all learn from somebody else. When we're reading these books and listening to these podcasts, it's like, what's the idea I can use in my life? We're not building the next Walmart. There's no way if we read Titan that we could tell did this actually happen. I don't know, but I'm looking for the ideas behind it. Not, oh, I'm going to verify for every single word in this book. That's ridiculous. And the truth is always, it is always the case that a clean narrative is grafted onto a fact pattern. And it's like, okay, well, what I care about is the lessons I can learn from the clean narrative, does the fact pattern, if you had all the facts in totality, did it necessarily mean that this was premeditated? It's like, whether it was premeditated or not, the facts are the facts and maybe I can duplicate it in a different realm. For what we do, I think on Acquired more than you, especially because you will do multiple episodes of different books on the same people. And multiple episodes on the same book. Yeah, and multiple episodes on the same book. Your format is better. We're doing a narrative weave. So like, you know. We're shooting the moon a little bit more in this respect. Your format lends itself to, so if anyone is listening, Founders is more about, hey, I just read this book and I want to tell you what I learned from this book. And it's always biography. And sometimes you'll do five different biographies on Edwin Land. And if Acquired was going to do Polaroid, we would do Polaroid. The episode would be Polaroid. Maybe it would be Polaroid part one and part two, or maybe at some point we'd have someone on to talk about the story in addition to our one canonical episode. But we would be shooting the moon on, let's make sure that we get the Polaroid story as right. It's almost like, how do we find the correct average of all of the other stories to create the canonical version? I wasn't expecting to quote Bill Gurley two times earlier so far. But that's a- Because now you know this is gonna be a good episode. That fantastic talk he gave, which to me is the best talk for entrepreneurs and investors on YouTube. It's called Running Down a Dream, How to Survive and Thrive in a Career You Love. And he says this, he's like, listen, in the age of the internet, he's like, you don't have to be the smartest person. Charlie Munger, after talking to him, whatever mind that dude has, I don't have that. And I'm cool with that. I could not imagine trying to compete against that guy 40 years ago. He would destroy me. He's got a super mind that I don't have. But what Bill says is, you don't have to be the smartest person, but you can collect the most information and he holds you to a high standard in that talk. Bill's like, listen, in the age of the internet, all the information you possibly need is right at your fingertips. You have no excuse not to do this. And so he gives the example of, if you wanna be a domain expert in whatever you're doing, within two years of intense study, if you're doing that and you're focused on it, you're gonna get to the point where you know more than maybe anybody else. And so that's my whole thing was, when you talk to, you've never met a founder or entrepreneur that's kind of into entrepreneurship. It's like, no, it's our lives. So of course, the reason why so many of them listen to both of our shows, right, it's because they're building machines where they literally can turn knowledge into profit. Right, I've become close friends with the guy through the podcast. He's a young kid, I don't mean to call him a kid, he's not a kid, but he's a lot younger than I am. And he's like 28 years old. And we were on the phone the other day because he had a very serious offer for a company he owns like 95% of, they were gonna give him a hundred million dollars, right? I wasn't saying no to it. But the point of it is, when you talk to him, you know, he's listened to all the episodes, he's read like 60 of the books, he'll text me a picture of like, he won't even tell me what the book, and I'm like, I'm pretty sure I read that. Like, he's like, oh yeah, it's from this episode. It's like, oh, why? What if he finds one idea in a book, one idea in a podcast, and it gives a 10% improvement on his company? It's a $10 million idea. Yeah, well, we were talking about this earlier, like this dinner that you have, it sounds like the Charlie is just like a very curiosity driven machine, but we know there's lots of folks that have regular dinners and have groups of people, often geographically dispersed, why do they do it? Why is it worth their time, their money, their effort? It's that, they get one idea. The leverage that they can get on that is astronomical. Charlie tells a story, he's like, yeah, I made $400 million from reading Barron's for 50 years, and you're like, what the, what are you talking about, Charlie? And Charlie's like, well. And how do you quantify that? Because he does, so he goes, I read, this isn't something he said at dinner, that I've heard him say publicly. He's like, I read Barron's all the time for 50 years, I found one idea that I can act on, I made $50 million on that deal, and then I took that 50 million and I gave it to Lee Lu. Is that the, oh yeah, yeah. I gave that 50 million to Lee Lu, and Lee Lu turned it into $400 million. That's how I made $400 million from reading Barron's. Wow. And listen, I'm not, and this is another thing where I feel like everybody's like, oh, this time is different, this is new. It's like human nature has never changed. It will never change. This time is not different. You're just, the difference is if you don't study the history of the people that came before you, you're just ignorant and making mistakes that people already saw in the past. Learning from history is a form of leverage. Hmm. He has billions and billions, or not, yeah, billions and billions of years of collectives like human history. You know, this guy spent 70 years and there's thousands of them. And like Sam Walton's book, how many people spent 50 years in one industry, in the retail industry, and he distilled it down to the most important. And then wrote a book about it. And then you could read it in a week, and then you could listen to a choir's episodes, you can listen to David's episodes on Sam. In addition to that. So the question is then, do you have 90% of Sam's wisdom, or do you have 0.1% of Sam's wisdom after? There's no way you have 90%. Right. Because like the time, like the instincts. I was just rewatching Peter Thiel's talk at Y Combinator, he says, competitions for losers. Oh yeah. And he goes, one thing that we do in Silicon Valley is we overrate, overvalue growth rates and undervalue durability. And he's like, that doesn't make sense for a technology company because all your profits the vast majority of profits are 20 years in the future. And so if you're trying to optimize for growth, and that over optimization can cause your company to go out of business, you're never gonna collect that. You optimize your durability first, dummy. Like that's to me, like my interpretation of what he's saying, right? Yeah, so you're gonna get, you know, 1% probably. Maybe 5%. But that's still enormous leverage. Cause you read it in five hours, and he took 50 years to emulate everything. And it's Sam Walton's wisdom. And it's what you do with the idea. I know you've talked about this before, but like what was the moment where you're like, I'm gonna start this podcast. Like it's crazy, right? What you do. You talk to a microphone yourself every week. Yeah, my friend. Not that I think you're crazy. Oh, I definitely am. You are, but in a good way. No, I definitely am nuts, for sure. And that's gonna be like, we can talk about, did you guys read Jeff Bezos' last shareholder letter before he, the best lines he has is at the end. He's like, differentiation is survival. And so they think about that, like how hard, like they say, let's say somebody says, damn, I love what Ben and David are doing. I'm gonna do the exact same thing. They can jump in and try to do that, right? But you have six years of experience. You have 600 hours out there. You have to counter position against us. Or address a different audience. Which by the way, they definitely should. Every time I talk to somebody who wants to, without, I'm always like, you absolutely should do this. Yeah. And you will, even if you never succeed in terms of any like numerical success, or like you will succeed because you are learning. So being a nut job and completely crazy is, I think, makes you harder to compete with. And it's also, we're gonna go all over the map here, but it's impossible not to be that. Like think about how seeped you guys are in the same information that I am, where it always says, oh, you're the sum of your five friends or whatever, right? Well it's also like what you, you're the sum of your podcasts you listen to and the books you read. And so what happens- Oh, it's your five friends including your parasocial relationships. And so now what happens is like, you mentioned, dude, like you only read like one book about him, you'll go crazy. And so what happens is when I'm really interested in somebody, I will, I listen to Bill Gurley. Again, I just take advice from people who are smarter than me. Bill said, go collect everybody, everything you can. Okay, I'll do that. This is, these are simple ideas. And so I'll find somebody that's interesting, I'll read everything about him. And so with Charlie, I have like a little Charlie Munger on my shoulder. I have a little Steve Jobs, a little Edwin Land, a little David Olgovey, Estee Lauder, Coco Chanel, all these people that have been heroes of mine, James Dyson. And so now I'm presented with a situation that's like, what would they do? And you have, if you read and spend, and absorb everything that's out there about these people, you'll have an idea of how they would respond. Did you guys ever read Ken Koseanda's book, Creative Selection? About the, oh, that's shocking. He worked on the original human interface for the iPhone. So he made the keyboard for when it was still that's right, for iPhone OS. For Operation Purple or something. Yeah, P2. The keyboard, he made Safari before the iPhone. He has this excellent book that I've read three times called Creative Selection. Think the, how Apple designed products in Golden Age of Steve Jobs might be the subtitle. But he talked about that, where he demoed to Steve, right? And you're not gonna describe it to him. You're gonna demo and you're gonna hand it to him. And so they iterate, you guys already know this, they iterate through a series of demos. And it's based on Steve's taste. Like he is not, oh, let's talk about this. Like nope, do this, do this, that. And so Ken has a great line in the book where he's like, demoing for Steve is like asking questions to the Oracle Delphi, except the Oracle Delphi would like respond with a riddle. And he's like, no, no, Steve was unbelievably like crystal clear. You understood him. Out of every single person I've ever studied, Steve Jobs is by far the clearest thinker I have ever come across. Like I was just gifted at that. Charlie is like the Oracle and it's crystal clear. You are not, like you are gonna understand what he's, the idea he's trying to get into your brain, for sure. But my point being is like all of the people that we study, they don't denigrate the past. Steve Jobs, the reason I'm so obsessed with Edwin Land, I read in a bio-review. When Steve was like in his 20s, Edwin Land is in like 70s, he goes and meets Edwin Land and he goes, visiting Edwin Land was like visiting a shrine. He's like, he is my hero, more people should try to be like that. And then you guys made the point in that, you know, Jeff Bezos took a lot of ideas from Sam, who took a bunch of ideas from Sony too, Steve and Jeff. So you always find these people where you're like, oh, I thought this was a Steve Jobs idea. No. No, it's an Akio Morita idea. Yeah. Or an Edwin Land idea. Like when we used to watch the presentations that Steve would give where he's like, oh, we're building at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. He put it up on screen. He ripped that off wholesale. Edwin Land said that exact word. But that's the point. It's like, you're never gonna find anybody gets to the top of their profession without doing the work, like studying the people that came before them and learning from them and admiring them. This is a good like sort of personal pivot. And it's like, I've never asked you in all the hours we spent. It's crazy, this is the first time we've met in person. Yeah. And for hours and hours and hours on Zoom, how did you like decide that this is what you were gonna do with your time on this planet? And like, what led to this? Okay, so I, you know, our mutual friend, Jeremy, from Formula of Tiny, I just spent like a bunch of hours with him, he was in town. In one sentence, he psychoanalyzed me better than anybody else ever has. He goes, you didn't have any mentors growing up. So you like, you have, then you took it to like this extreme and he said it much more eloquently than I am. But he's like, you didn't have any mentors. So I view your career as like the psychopathic search for like mentors that can help you, you know? And so like to answer your questions, like I don't wanna go into too much detail here. But like, I've only had one habit my whole life and that was reading. I was reading for as long as I can remember. My mom passed away from breast cancer a couple years ago. And she, we didn't have like a lot of money, like long story, but like I was the first person not only to graduate college, but I was also the first person to graduate high school in my family. Like I came from a family that like, unfortunately both sides of the family, like no education, a lot of like just bad habits. So I identify with a lot of what Charlie Munger says because he essentially observes bad behavior and then tries to do the opposite, right? So I was just, let me give you an example. I was just up in Canada, actually at an event, Andrew Wilkinson was hosting for a bunch of entrepreneurs. Me, Shane Parrish from the Knowledge Project and Farnham Street was up there, Ben Wilson from How to Take Over the World and we were doing this panel together. And Shane's the moderator. And we don't know what we're gonna talk about beforehand. And so Shane asked the question, it's like, oh, what did you learn most from your upbringing or something like that, right? And I go, I learned not to do cocaine and to graduate high school. Like, so that kind of thing, right? And so there was just a bunch of anti-models. I thought about this as I was walking through the Tenderloin this morning in San Francisco. And I was like, I should do this walk with my daughter as the best, like, hey, this is why you don't do drugs. Like, this is the perfect example of, like, you observe bad behavior and then you do the opposite. So long story short, I've always been obsessed with reading. Like, one of the best things my mom ever did was even if we didn't have money for books, she would take me to the bookstore and just sit there. Like, you know, bookstores are so cool because they just let you read. No one comes to her like, hey, you've been reading for an hour, like, you gotta get out of here, you know? And just reading, reading, reading. So I was all. Was there anybody who, like, introduced you to reading and books or you just, like, there was just something about you. Sounds like it's mom. Yeah, but no, she wasn't a big reader. The only thing she read was the Bible. There was no books in the house when I was younger, ever. So how did you be like, mom, take me to the bookstore? I can't answer that. All I can say is, like, my wife has known me for 15 years and her thing, what she says is she, like, likes my family and gets along with them, but she goes, how did that come from that? I know, it's like. It sounds like you have a classic, like, you're the one who made it out story. Sam Hinky, our mutual friend, actually gave me a way to think about this and it's called the founder of your family, right? And it's the person that, like, and I used to call them, and it was a terrible name, but generational inflection points because you'd read this in the biography where you have, like, generation after generation of just not good things happening and then one person just says, it stops now. That's what Rockefeller did. Rockefeller. I always think of Sam Brompton, the guy that did Seagrams. Oh yeah. And he's in Canada growing up. But, like, their parents had lost so much money that they think they were Jewish and they had to, like, escape from persecution in Russia. I can't remember where they came from, but they go and they have to start all over and they're in Canada and, like, there's no heating and, like, they're freezing and, like, so he has this, like, psychopathic drive to change, but that stays with you forever. So, like, once, you know, he builds this massive company and literally changes the trajectory of all of his descendants and his daughter's an adult and she tells a story in the book where Sam is sitting there in, like, a mansion by next to a fire, like, shivering, thinking about how embarrassing it was to have to go to school with tighter clothing. It's just like, that guy's never gonna go back to that and he never loses it. So, I've just always been a reader. That's the only thing I've ever, like, the only one unbroken habit I've always had. And so I just had this idea, like, I was obsessed with podcasts forever. I was obsessed with audio before there was such thing as a podcast. Like, I would listen to talk radio when I was a kid and at that time, you know, it's not like, there's no on-demand anything. You would listen to sports talk radio, politics talk radio. It's embarrassing, there was like this woman that used to be on at night, people would write in, like, advice for their love life and I'd listen to that. Just the idea of, like, there's all this information. Oh man, I used to listen to Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. Do you ever listen to this? Like, it's when all the other radio programming sort of expires and then you enter the, like, one in the morning AM radio stuff and it was like, you know, aliens and, like, tons of paranormal stuff. But it was like, if you listen, like, you know, the Cavs game ends, I'm from Cleveland, and so, like, then you listen to, like, the sports post game and then it goes into, like, the politics hour and if you still can't fall asleep, then you're into, like, aliens and it's, like, four hours of that stuff. Do you have a radio in your bedroom? Oh yeah, I'd be able to, I imagine my parents probably came and turned it off, but, like, I'd leave it on while I fell asleep every night. And then remember, like, I remember, so you have the jump off from that and then the AM radio stations would then start streaming to your browser, internet, it still wasn't on-demand, so if you're not listening at three o'clock or 12, like, you miss it, and then once I saw a pod. Wasn't this what Mark Cuban's company was? His was, like, broadcasting audio for sports games, though, I think. I don't actually know, it's kind of funny, it's like an era of the. It's broadcast.com, right? Yeah. Yeah. And it was competitive with Real Player, which also wasn't on-demand, that was just streamed radio. No, the first on-demand was, the first time I saw this, it was like, this is insane. Like, especially for people that are, like, you know, learning machines using Charlie's, where it's like, I can go to, even today, like they did, you can go to any podcast player, type in what everyone will learn about, and then you can hear somebody that's usually spent hundreds of hours teaching you about this stuff. You can also find intellectual, high-quality content more easily now, because all content, because there were a limited number of channels and a limited number of time slots, everything had to be produced for the lowest common denominator, and now you can opt into your niche and find the highest quality content in that niche. The only way to do that before was books. Like, there wasn't an audio way to, there wasn't content. There wasn't niche audio content broadly available. And there aren't really several million authors out there, but there's several million podcasters. Well, you made a good, I think you were getting to a good point, it's like, because the business model didn't support that. And so now, And there was no distribution. And now with podcasting, it's like, you guys, you know, I'm sure, I think like, I don't ever look at analytics, but I think last time I looked, it was like 50% of my audience was in the United States, but then everywhere. And so I was doing, the early days of founders, I was just, I remember it all changed because I couldn't figure out the business model, so you would do like affiliate, you know, at that time, I remember when I first started, You went through a bunch of business models. Yeah, so when I first started, they're like, hey, you contact like the few podcast advertising networks there were back then, you know, because you guys started your show in 2016, right? 15. 15. Okay, so I started in 2016. And you contact me, like, yeah, we can do ads for your show. You know, you need like 25,000 downloads an episode. And at the time, I'm like, I'll never get there. Like, obviously we've skyrocketed past that, but like, that's impossible. It's like as many people as in a basketball arena. Oh, when you start visualizing the audience, it's like, oh, two and a half NFL stadiums show up for every acquired episode. Like, that's an insane. Yes, but do you guys think, so do you guys think about that? Only in adding to the pressure in a good way, like it's a good motivator. I never think about it. Really? You know what I think about it, how my show's set up is why I say you and I and I. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like how you treat the audience as like the person you're meeting. It's one person. So like, and I've done this forever. It's like, it's funny. I remember to one of my friends that we were met up one day and I was like, man, I think I'm gonna try to make like a business around the fact that I read so much. And he's like, and he called me like a year, like six months ago, a year ago. He's like, I can't believe you did that. He's like, I thought you were, that was the dumbest thing I ever heard. But I just picture him when I started, it's like, oh, the whole idea behind the show was like, what if you got to meet up once a week with your friend that reads a lot and he just tells you the stuff that he read that week, like interesting ideas. And so I was picturing one person. Did it cross your mind to like try and convince him to do the podcast with you or somebody else? Or do you always just like, no, I'm gonna. So one thing, we don't have like a bunch of prepared stuff, but one thing us three talked about, it's like, hey, why don't we talk about like, who was your influence on why you do what you do? And so I feel the greatest podcaster of all time is Dan Carlin from Harker History. That's like my, I think he's like, I can't believe what that guy does, right? You and him are like the only successful monologue podcasters. Like I think it's the hardest thing to do in this medium. And I can't, I mean, there's everyone else either has a guest on or a cohost. Yeah, well, there's another guy that was that. So I took Dan Carlin, I was like, I was obsessed with his. I've listened to all his episodes. For like years, you were talking about falling asleep. I did that too, but I fell asleep to Dan Carlin. So I'd over and over and over again. To now where I listen to him, I'm like, it's like, it's a. Have love in. Yeah, it's like, no, don't wake up. It's not nighttime, bro, wake up. But there was another one that a friend of mine put me on. So there's this comedian named Bilbur. He does the Monday morning podcast. He used to do it every Monday. Now he does, I think Monday and Thursdays, right? He is one of the first podcasters. When he was podcasting his first episodes, at the time he would do it. He would call into a number and record, right? And then there was a service that would transform that recording from your phone into an MP3 that you could publish. You could download and put on your iPod. This is way before anything. And so. It's so wild how things have, I mean, we're here now in this recording setup that we have here with thousands of dollars a year. And like, I remember when we first started, I don't think you let me do this, but I was like, well, why don't we just talk at the computer and like set up QuickTime. Dude, when I listened back to our first few episodes, I was like, Pixar, and I'm like, it sounds like we were just talking at the computer. It was rough. We basically were. That's when people were like, I have a lot of psychos that, they're like, I start on number one, I go all the way through, I was like, oh, please don't. If you're gonna do, go in the opposite order. This is one of the things I wanted to talk about. I used to. Because that way, at least by the time you get to one, you're a fan, but if you start at one, you're like, oh, these guys just suck. But like that, it's almost like, there's great pleasure in hearing something that you think is excellent and fully baked. And like, especially when it's been long running, you're like, oh, this has always been immaculate and perfect. And then you get to go see some of the early work and you're like, oh, it's so rough. You want the early Charlie. I can see where the magic was, even though they didn't know yet. Like the colonel's there. It's the same thing you see in the books that you're reading, though. Like Sam Walton, when you tell a story where his landlord screws him over. He goes, I'm not whipped. I found this store. I'll do it again, right? And it's like, yes, Walmart is a huge success. You guys made the point that, that was a great point where it's like, you're never gonna think 25 years in the future when there's watermelons and donkey crap on the ground that this is gonna be the richest family in the world. If you add it. And the most standardized form of retail. And so you see, oh, that same guy that became the richest person in the world, that now has a rich family or whatever, it's like, he's imperfect too, just like I am. And so that is the only benefit of listening to an early acquired or early founder. It's like, oh, you see the improvement. Just like in the books, you see the improvement. Well, it's fun too. Like I like going back and listening to some of your old episodes because I get to see your journey. It's like, I'm proud of you. But I've been thinking about it, and I was thinking about it ahead of our conversation here. I used to say all the time, people are like, oh, I go back, I listen to their early episodes. I'm like, no, don't, it's so embarrassing. I actually think we always wanna be embarrassed by our last episode. We've just constantly kept every episode, we try and just notch it up. Because we keep picturing the stadium. That's why I think about the stadium because I think about the pressure of, we gotta do better next time than we did this time. And it's not just filled with Seattle's NFL fans. It's filled with hundreds of thousands of the smartest people that, and this gets to the psyche, the deep insecurities that at least I have of, I want to impress those people. I want those people to think I'm smart. And so I have to produce something unbelievably worthwhile of their time. And the minute that I don't, I'm literally walking out in front of an NFL stadium full of people that I want to impress. And I didn't used to have that pressure, but once we found content market fit for acquired, with people that I've always thought highly of, that is the driver now. There were a couple years where we kinda drifted, there wasn't that pressure to keep amping the bar. And then it happened. It's like the 2017 era. I think you're never gonna be embarrassed about your, your latest episode at the time we're making this is LVMH. You're never gonna be embarrassed about that. That was excellent. And like, that was. It doesn't mean you can't keep improving 10 years from now. No, like I look back and I think like, yes, that's certainly an episode, I don't know how you feel, but like I'm proud of, but I look back, like at the time, like so we didn't know that was gonna be a super popular episode. Yeah, that was totally unpredictable. It's our, it's our, cause we haven't shared this publicly yet. It's our number one episode by a huge margin. 40,000 more people have listened to that episode than the next highest, which was Amazon.com. That's incredible. I probably could have told you, actually I was like, David, no one's gonna listen to Amazon cause everyone already knows this story, which was super wrong. But I either thought like, no one will listen to this one, or like, this will be our most successful episode. With LVMH, even after we recorded it, I was like, or after we edited it, cause we had to like edit a lot of stuff. But I was like, this is how much we didn't know. But it's not like our best ever, but apparently. I think it might be my favorite episode of yours. And I heard from a ton of other people how much they liked it. Like it's really good. Well, thank you. But to the conversation, like there's a bunch of stuff that we could have done better in that episode, like a whole bunch. So I do this all the time where like, I'll go back and listen to old episodes because people are like, this weird, you don't send me a podcast. It's like, no, this is a tool. That's how you get better. This is a tool. Game footage. No, we even try to get better. It's like, I was like, oh, I haven't read that book in like two years. I'll just listen to my episode on it. And it like, it's a tool for me. That's how I know it's good for other people. Right? And so I was like, and then I'll listen to it. I'm like, oh, wow, I forgot that. I need to keep that idea in my mind. But I'll hear myself like, oh, you said that in two paragraphs. That could have been one paragraph cut that part. That doesn't make sense. And so, yeah, I understand the improvement. But what I'm saying is your qualities are already super high. Like it can increase and get better. Don't get me wrong, but like, you're never gonna be embarrassed. You're just like, oh, I could probably do 20%, 30% better, which is still excellent from the level you're at. So the way that we edit is our editor takes the first pass and he's unbelievably good and we're so lucky to have him. And then he sends us a rough cut. I upload it to Descript. And then we listen like, and read while we're listening, word for word, sentence for sentence, and try to cut every unnecessary sentence. And we end up pulling out 20ish minutes of just fluff. It's just like, okay, we could have been tighter in that point. Is there a way to get tighter in it without rerecording it? And I think that has dramatically contributed to episode quality. Cause by the time we ship it, neither of us feel that there are extraneous sentences. So I don't know if I'm like that. You're still a one man show, right? I do everything. No one touches anything. Everything, soup to nuts. I'm gonna ask you a question, but I also think like we should, this is a perfect point to like how we became friends and why like I'm putting this out on my feed and no one, you're gonna be the first non-David center voices that ever heard on founders. And they only would agree to do it. And I only agree to do it with you guys is because like this goes back to like why I wanna be surrounded with first of all, people that have like interest, super smart people, but also people that have like positive some thinking, right? Patrick O'Shaughnessy has this gigantic successful show. Invest Like The Best, he's got Colossus Podcast Network. His fund is called Positive Some and that's how he acts. I joined his network, this is like months later. And they're like, hey, like, you know, we have editors, whatever. He has like this empire over there. And resources, he's like, what do you want? And I was like, I just want you to amplify my audience and then connect me with first rate advertisers. Because like, I think Acquired is a luxury podcast, maybe not luxury, premium, we gotta go over the distinction there from LVMH, but like we're saying, no, no, this is like, we're trying to set the bar here. But anyways, he's like, hey, do you want editors? You want any of this stuff? I was like, no, I don't want, no one gets to touch my stuff. Like people think, oh, like, do they tell you what books to read? And like, no, Patrick liked my show. And he's just like, why would I tell you? Like, just whatever you're doing, just do it to more people now. And so to answer your question, no, like I pick the books, I record them, I edit, I'm still one person show. I don't know if that'll happen forever, but I do think the fact that it just like spends so much time with the material gets it in my brain. But the reason that, like, I wanna talk about the role you guys played in that, where we were getting on Zoom and for like, the background here is like, you know, we had known of each other. I talked to Ben a long time ago because he was running this private podcast. This is like years ago. And so anyways, we're like, you're- That's also funny to think back, like all the dead ends that we went to, like we went down a ton of them, you went down a ton of them. You're about to talk about some of them. Like there's so many dead ends. But they're in the books too. Yeah, but they're in the book. That's exactly it. Will we change the name of the show to adapting? Oh my God, that was, that was a dead end. That was on me, that one was on me. Tell the story. COVID happened and we were like, no one wants to hear these stories of like, extreme capitalism. Like we're like the X games of capitalism. And like, this is a moment where like, everyone is hurting, zero business. And like, this is in the stock market trough too, where you're just like, wow, like, you know, all businesses are gonna go under. No one's ever gonna have jobs again. This is, you know, this is scary. And so we were like, well, like, what stories should we tell? How about businesses that are adapting to make it through this tough time and to like, show how serious we were about it. We changed the name of the show. It was like our three least listened to episodes covering a pretty amazing stories, but we just branded it wrong. Like, Candlest is like the most interesting restaurant story you could ever hear about. And like, that's the only time we've ever done Intel. That's the only time we've done Intel. But because it was adapting, not a quiet, it was stupid. So stupid. But you, there's no way to do like learn, rather than screw up. Do you wanna know the first name of founders? Ooh. You know, like in your RSS feed, you can change the name, right? We can't change the link, like it'll still say. So you look at it from mine and it's Autotelic. The worst name. Autotelic comes from this book called Flow. How do you even spell that? A-U-T-O-T-E-L-I-C maybe, I don't know. I can't spell for it. I can't spell, pronounce, I have no grammar. So I was like, you read so much. I was like, I don't pay attention to any of that stuff. Is that the Mihai? Yes. The guy that said Flow. The Czech Mihai? Yes, it is an activity that you do for the sake of itself. Going back to your questions, like why, like I just love to read. I'm gonna do this if no one listens. Like, that's how I know I'm gonna win. Because it's like, people are like, oh, would you do it for free? It's like, no, no, I paid to do this. Like, for a long time. For a long time. Like, I literally said I'm gonna quit and I'm gonna, I have the savings. I have a wife and a baby, or a daughter to support. Now I have a son, a wife, a daughter, and a son. And I was like, I bet you, I just put trust in myself. It's just like, I'm going to, if I focus on this, seven days a week, I'll figure out the business model. I know, like, I don't think I'll ever get rich from it, but I will at least pay my bills, right? And so like, every month I'm like, oh, less money there. So I paid to do it. So the idea where like, you know, again, people get, I think Steve Jobs talks about this, like the older he gets, he said something like, the older he gets, the more he realizes why people do things matters. And so he's always asking those questions. Like, I always say, it's like, how do you know that you found what you love to do? And people are like, oh, because, like, I wouldn't sell my company. It's like, okay, there's another level. It's like, how much would you have had to pay Steve Jobs to stop working at Apple? The answer is, he wouldn't take all the money in the world. How much would you have to pay Charlie Munger? A lot of people tried to stop Steve Jobs from working at Apple. Yeah, but like, think about that. Like, the idea is like, he's not doing it for money. He's in a different game. He's doing it for the sake of itself. And so I went through a bunch of different names, history's greatest men, history's greatest, like history, all this, they were terrible names. And I just started narrowing it more and more and more to like founders. And I was like, oh, that's perfect. There is a question. Cause you weren't even, like, you weren't coming from the tech world. You weren't like, this wasn't content marketing. It was just like, the idea I had known about like Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, and all these other people. And I remember you had Kevin Rose on your show a long time ago. So you guys remember his, if you would've stepped out of the age group. Maybe a year, year and a half. Yeah, yeah, it just, time flies. Cause it was post, he was, He was during COVID. He was pretty much already fully web three by the time we. So do you guys remember Foundation? Yeah, of course. One of the first high quality. Yeah. Like imagine if you would've stuck with that show. Like, you know what I mean? Like it would've been a monster. And it's like the only episodes that ever came out was like, here's me interviewing Elon Musk. Here's me interviewing Sam Altman. Here's me. And like these people, and also before they became like icons of our time. That's it. Elon had the model. That was the only thing. He was just about to release the Model S. You have the Roadster. No, they were in the factory. Cause I watched it. I watched it all the time. They were in the factory building the Model S. That's right. So it was, I don't know if you could buy it yet, but it was like coming or whatever. And Elon looks way younger and like, you know, and then in 2015, Tim Ferriss, I was a big fan of his podcast. I read like, you know, Four Hour Workweek. I remember the way I discovered- Dude, Four Hour Body changed my life. Did it? Yeah. With the slow carb? Yup, slow carb diet. I did that too. Slow carb diet, cold showers. Like I did, and the funniest thing is like, this is like this whole cold plunge thing that's like becoming a thing now. I'm like, was nobody like reading Tim Ferriss in 2011? Like it was a huge part of, yeah. Well, it goes back- Our demographic was. Actually, that made me think of something. Let me interrupt this story because I think it's really important. You're like, oh, is anyone gonna listen to our, like no one's gonna listen to our Amazon episode. They already know it. And so this is something that like, and you know, the most successful- Are you gonna quote Ogilvy? Yes. Yes. I've listened to enough founders to know. Yeah, because it's like, this is so key that people don't understand. It's like you're not advertising to Standing Army, you're advertising to Moving Parade. And so like, I will literally get on calls with like media company founders that are like selling ads or like building companies. I'm like, oh yeah, you must have read Ogilvy. They're like, what? And I was like, these are not new lessons. Like if, and again, this comes from the humility to realize, hey, Warren Buffett's smarter than me. So if that dude in his shareholder letters is saying, David Ogilvy is a genius, I'm like, wait a minute, this dude, how many businesses has Warren Buffett looked at at that point? How many founders and managers has he looked to? And he's like, this dude's a genius. Yeah. This is not rocket science, guys. Just go and like, let's search David Ogilvy on Amazon. Five books, good. Order them all. These days, it's search David Ogilvy in your podcast player of choice. That's, I went to three. Wait, but explain the Standing Army versus. So you're not advertising to Standing Army, you're advertising to Moving Parade. But what happens is like even when you put on the Sequoia episode, right? We went, me and David went on a hike in Stanford. And I was like, dude, you have this crazy back catalog. Every single day, you have more people following your podcast feed than you had the day before. I was like, and I, cause I knew this because I was a subscription podcast, right? Recount briefly your business model journey. So I'll give you a shorter breakdown because like I went through so many of them. I just put a hard paywall, listen to the first 30 minutes. You want to listen to all of them, then you pay, right? And it converted. This is when we had that chat that you were talking about. We were like, dude, you're doing it wrong. You're doing it wrong. Yeah, cause there's been times like this one where we're like, what the hell are you doing? But there's been other times where you come to us and you're like, do you know how good your Sequoia episodes were? And like the fact that you have four times the audience that you have now, and none of the 75% of those people have ever heard the Sequoia episode, what are you doing? And so you guys, we had this hike, this I'll give you the idea. Remember, not my idea. I don't get like, everything has already been done guys. Just speaking to the people listening, not you. You obviously know it's like, we've already been done. Just go see, hey, that person's smart. He learned from 40 year career. Like you're not gonna, the idea is you're not gonna pick up on idea you can use as silly. So I told David. I was thinking about this. There's some cases where it's not true, but I think most truly like iconic world changing businesses and founders, they build, they stand on the shoulders of giants, but they have one or multiple things that is novel that they come up with. It's the combination of these ideas. Like Sam Walton taking SoulPrice's ideas and his competitor ideas and like, hey, what about, you guys are kind of ignoring these like 4,000 person communities. I'm pretty sure like the thesis behind Walmart is like, will they just drive far distances just to save money? The answer is yes, five hours. But that isn't a novel idea. Yeah, exactly. That's the whole thing. It's combining like one big novel idea with a bunch of other things that you can learn from history. You guys combined David O'Greer's idea by republishing your Sakura podcast, and then you text me, you're like, oh my God. Like the downloads are crazy. And because the vast majority, because you're not podcasting to a standing army, you're podcasting to a moving parade. And so I had known this because through my experimentation, I would take an old episode that I had done, do a preview, throw it up, and you'd get conversions every time because it was new to them. And that was like, so Ogilvy, I credit Ogilvy for that idea. That's an idea he got from Claude Hopkins and Albert Lasker who were building advertising businesses 50 years before him. Is this a scientific advertising? Yes. Yeah, also a good founders episode. Yeah, he's excellent. That book, Scientific Advertising, sold like eight or 10 million copies. They kept it in Albert Lasker. So Claude Hopkins worked for Albert Lasker. Albert Lasker thought that book was so good, he stored it in a vault. Because it was like the secrets of the industry, right? Like don't publish this because we don't want this getting out. I learned that because in Ogilvy and advertising, at the very end of the book, David's like, here, these are the six giants that I learned from. So I was like, okay, well then I'm gonna Google search. Who's the, like, I'm gonna read the book. It's not rocket science, again. So then he's like, oh, Albert Lasker made more money than anybody else in the history of the advertising business. I was like, hold up, what? How? Also, none of us know this guy's name. Yeah, and so then you realize it's like, he says in the book, he's like, his estate outside of Chicago was so big, he had 40 full-time employees. I'm like, what? I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, make these words make sense in my mind. That doesn't make any sense to me. So you read Albert Lasker, and then he tells you about Claude Hopkins. He's like, yeah, the information was so good that I stored that in my vault for 20 years. And then once he sold his advertising, or I think he gave it away like a token, like $100,000 to the people working there, and then they released it, and Claude went off on his own and everything else. So these are not like. Okay, so you were doing the 30-minute hard cutoff when we had that famous. It's so unsatisfying. It's like, I'm gonna listen to 30 minutes of this episode, and then I have to get, someone's asking me to pay for the rest. But you probably have pretty good conversion, right? The conversion rates were higher, but you guys said, this is where. You had a local maximum. This is where you were very helpful. Like David, first of all, and you guys are nice, this is not the language you use. You're like, you idiot. That's it. But you guys are so nice. So it's like, dude, you're doing it wrong. Listen, for every one person, I think it was Ben that said this. It's like for every one person that would buy a podcast, there's 1,000 or 100 that would listen to them for free. It's about 100. Yeah, probably even more than that. And so then you guys would show me, you open the kimono. You're like, these are our downloads. This is who we advertise with. This is what we charge for advertising. You're just like. Well, the other really key insight is, so after spending a bunch of time with originally Kimberlite, then Glow, which then sold to Libsyn, and still what powers the acquired LP program, an interesting learning is most podcasts should generate about 50% of their revenue from direct monetization, some kind of membership program, or paywalling their feed, and about half from advertising. And the mass should sort of work out where that's gonna be the case. For the type of podcast that we are, where you have lots of founders and CEOs and hedge fund managers and the sorts of people listening, you could never ask someone to pay you in membership what they are worth to the most valuable advertiser for that slot. And so the way it sort of works out is like you're massively hamstringing your monetization potential if you make it membership only, because you'd have to be like, yes, please pay two to $5,000 a year in order to get access to this private thing, versus if you were to take that same piece of content and open it up to advertisers. You made the good point earlier, and we can elaborate on that, why you're so psychotic about this sentence needs to get out of here, like these two sentences, let's remove it, because if you could factor in the average hourly rate of the people in your audience, it is unbelievable. So even I think if you make what, a million dollars a year, we know people obviously in audiences make a lot more than that, but I think a million dollars a year is what, 500 bucks an hour or something like that? I don't know the math, I'm not a good math person. So you're asking if they listen to an hour long podcast of founders, it's like, that's $500, you cannot waste these people's time. So I never answer your question when you're like, hey, how do you guys think about this? Do you re-edit, or do you cut them out? I use Descript as well. I actually think the way I listen to founders is obviously listening to it, and listening and reading. The super power of podcasts is you can listen to it when you're doing something else. But when you're editing, though. But I think I'm gonna put all my podcasts up on YouTube, I don't have any video, but I think I'm gonna use Descript. So there is, some people have success just putting up the audio on an audio, like a static picture, and you can listen to it on YouTube. But I also think, I was like, well, if I'm gonna do that, might as well just have this, and that's kinda cool if you wanna use it, but don't have to. We did not find success doing that. This episode will be the first episode this year that's on YouTube, because we basically said, if there's not interesting video, then it's not a video podcast, and you can go find it in a podcast player. I'm using it just for search, and I would use it. I don't think I'm ever gonna do video anything, because it's so much simpler to do. Literally, what I'm saying is, I'm gonna upload the MP3 to YouTube. I'm not making a video, just because it is, they're eventually gonna have, they're not stupid, they're eventually gonna have the podcast player inside of YouTube. They released this 40-page document I read on their podcast goals on YouTube. Did I say that to you guys? No. I'll say that to you guys. So right now, I have YouTube Premium, so you can listen to them in the background, like a podcast player, but they need to have podcast functionality, it's still a video. So anyways, the way I do it is like, yes, I'm very aware that who's listening, I'm not ever gonna waste a lot of their time, and what I've found with the more practice I have for the podcast is, I'm able to edit on the fly, like I don't have a script, right? So like, I'll go through the book, I highlight, then write down whatever pops in my mind. I don't, like, just, first of all, the highlights, like, am I excited about that? Oh, that's interesting, highlight. Just go off instinct, right? And then write down something that, oh, that's like this, or that made me think of this, and I just write it down, right? Then I'll reread all these highlights the night before I record, so it's like the second time. You're doing this in physical books, right? Physical books, yeah. But you're putting your notes into Readwise? That happens after. Okay. That happens after, so the fifth time, every single book I do, I think I read the highlights five times, and the fifth time is me actually taking pictures of the physical book and putting it in Readwise. So Jeff, I was thinking about this yesterday, because I'm also slightly obsessed with Jeff Bezos, and he says- You're slightly obsessed with a lot of founders. That's why when we're like, we're sitting in chairs, like, dude, I'm gonna be forward. Yeah, we were setting up the camera angles before. Because you're what I love. We're like, we gotta move David's chair back here a little bit. If you ever watch the old Jeff Bezos interviews when he's first starting Amazon, he's skinny and bald. It's amazing. The one that's in that field outside the conference. Yes, I think this is the one, he's sitting, you see Grasp Me on him, I don't know if he's in a field, but he leans forward, and he's like, we're gonna be the most customer obsessed company ever. He's got that look on his face. That's how I am about founders. I'm like, you know. You're like, that dude's a psycho. But Jeff says something that he is. But Jeff says something in Invent and Wander, which is an excellent book, because it's all of his shareholder letters and transcripts of his speeches. Walter Isaacson did that, right? Yep. And all of his transcripts of his speeches, and he goes, do you really want to live in a world or to compete against somebody that's as good as you? Like, I certainly wouldn't. He states, and he's like, if you read his shareholder letters and listen to him talk, he's like, he's constantly looking for unfair advantages. And I think part of the fact that I have now over 20,000 highlights from hundreds of books, and I still have like 50 or 60 or maybe 80 books that I haven't put in there yet that are in my library. So it's like, my Readwise account is an unfair advantage, because any time somebody's talking, it's like, I can immediately, oh, you said something, I search for that term, and it pulls up. And it's like, oh, and then I see my highlight, and I see my note. It takes so long, like so long to do that, but it's worth the extra five or 10 hours a week. And that's integrated into your process of making notes. Yes, because I'm reading something, and I remember, no, I know I've seen this before, I can't remember it. Type in that term, and it pulls up every single instant. Wow. Instance I would take. To get brain outside your brain. It's an unfair advantage that I have with me all the time. And what I'll do is, like whenever I'm waiting for an Uber today, right, just pull up Readwise, and Readwise has the highlights feed. And I'll show you guys what it looks like. It looks a lot like a Twitter feed, right? Completely random, so I'm not choosing this. And instead of me reading Twitter all day, which is not a good use of your time, it's this highlight from the Dodge Brothers. I haven't read that book, that was like episode, probably in the 115s. Billy Durant, who's the founder of GM. Sam Colt. And so are these ones that other people have liked a lot, so therefore? No, no. It's just repopulating your own. Yes. Oh, that's awesome. So it's my form of practice. So you've got, whoa. Let me give you an example. You've got a healthy Twitter there on your phone. So is that what, like, how many times a day, like how often are you just pulling up Readwise? Almost every day. And if I'm not doing it on Readwise, I'll go to like my bookshelves. So what will happen is, you can pull a book off my shelf, and I'm thinking about this for like my kids. Long after I'm gone, my kids can be like, what was my dad into? You know, and they can go back and see, oh, and when he was 35 or 38, this is the podcast he made. Let me go find that book. And then he could pull off the shelf, like, oh, this is the line he thought was interesting. Oh, wow, you see dad's handwriting here. So I use this for myself where I can pick up a book and quote unquote, read it, re-read it in 30 minutes by re-reading my highlights and notes. And now I'm like, it's back in front of mine. And then what happens is like, you can do this anytime. People are like, oh, I'm running late for lunch. I'll just do this, or I'll answer DMs, or I always have stuff to do with me. But I use it as a form of practice. The reason I said this is like, it sounds stupid. People think it's maybe, maybe they think it's silly, I don't know. I read this book, it's episode 212 of Founders, it's called Michael Jordan, The Life. It's a 600 page biography. And in that book. You just have like this encyclopedia knowledge to have the numbers of your episodes, which I'm so impressed by. I don't, it's only because I reference that all the time, so when if you look up something over and over again, it's repetition. Everything in life is repetition. Sam Walton's career is repetition. You know, like it's like, I just think you're trying to, this is what I asked Charlie. Like, one of the most interesting things he said, he's like, one of the best things that ever happened to me is I got rich later in life. You know, he saw the time and how difficult it was. Like, he was talking about like, imagine you being like super famous or rich when you're like 21 or 25 and how disorienting. He's like, I was a full grown man. Like with life experiences with a wife and kids. He had a child who died. Yeah, I did not mention that, yeah. But like he had all, like a full life experience and therefore also, the main problem that happens is people don't know. They're like, I was the son of a poor man, now I'm rich and my kids live an unbelievable amount of wealth and privilege, how do I deal with that? That comes up in the books for hundreds of years. The answer is no one knows, right? And so with Charlie though, the benefit is he didn't have a famous last name or a lot of wealth. His kids were like grown. They wouldn't have to deal with that when you're five or seven or 10. He also gave me some advice that was fascinating. You do that, like, you gotta pay that bill eventually though like his grandkids have to. Well, so how do you deal with this though, right? Like he's multi-billionaire, like that's an insane, this is a five generation problem. Not only is he a multi-billionaire, he's like, people like us talk for hours about him. He's like a celebrity. So I just read this fantastic book. I like reading obscure books because go back to what Jeff Bezos said, differentiation is survival. So like I'll find like weird books. Like me and Sam were in this weird, I was searching for books for you guys, I couldn't find any. I will order them and bring them to you because I always bring books. And I was really, we went to three different bookstores. I'm not kidding. You brought energy drinks instead. But no, we like, bless Sam and his patience with me and like drove me all around Menlo Park and Palo Alto yesterday going to bookstores. Like I was literally looking for you guys. Like you had specific books in mind. No, no, I like going to used bookstores and I think of my interpretation of you guys in my mind. And I just know if this book is good for that person. Like the Charlie, the Henry Flagler book, I knew that was good for Charlie Munger because of what he said. So I don't know what's gonna happen. Now I do have two books picked out for you guys, which I'll send you, but they're like newer books. But anyways, by the way, that sounds like a great day, driving around with Sam Pinky and going to bookstores. Like what better day could you spend? Also the peninsula is like beautiful. Yeah, and like Sam's unbelievably intelligent and like she's got a weird alien brain. As I always tell him, our mutual friend Mitchell Baldritch, that all three of us know, says Sam has a gigabrain. I think it's what he said, his description of it. But I like obscure books. I read this book that is very hard to find. It's like 300 bucks. It's called The Invisible Billionaire, Daniel Ludwig. It was the richest person in the world in the 80s and no one knew who he was. He paid a public relations firm to keep his name out of the papers. Okay? Do what your competitors don't. Yeah, so he's just like, I don't wanna be known. And a lot of his was like shipping and oil and refining and mining and all that other stuff. But the author made this point in the book, like how different a million and a billion is, going back to Charlie Munger, right? And he goes, a million dollars in a stack of $100 bills is like 40 inches, you know? A billion dollars in a stack of $100 bills would be three times taller than the Empire State Building. Yeah. And so for us, like, oh, that guy's kinda rich. He's like, no, the billionaire and millionaires are not in the same category. It's so disorienting. This is also a thing where the English language has done us a disservice by naming two things that are a thousand times different, very similar words. It sounds similar. Yeah, they're not similar at all. Well, a lot of people are asking, I think about all the wealthy people that Charlie talks to. And they're asked, like, okay, what do I do with this wealth with my kids? And it's like, if you give your kids a bunch of money, is it gonna demotivate them? And Charlie goes, of course it's going to. So he's like, but he's like, you know, it's like, again, this should be obvious to you. So he says, don't try to steer his kids or his grandkids into what they should do for a living, which is Charlie Munger's one of his best piece of advice that I took to heart, it's like follow your natural drift. Like, how I pick books. There's been like 15 or 20 that I've read completely or half and it's like, I don't like this book, I'm not making an episode about it. I go to my bookshelf and I have like, probably 80 or 100 books I haven't read yet. Most come from the audience. And I was like, what am I most excited to learn about now? And that's how I pick it, right? So following natural drift. Which is also more or less how we pick episodes too. We have a little bit more planning because now like there's such long lead times, but it's kind of like, what's interesting to us right now? 100%. So he's like, you know, don't try to steer them too much. And he's like, he definitely feels that some of them are gonna be less motivated because they're born rich, but he said this was the most surprising thing. But he goes, you have to give them the money anyways or they're gonna hate you for it. And I was like, that's like, because my answer before this, I've read so many like family dynasty stories and I'm not saying I'm trying to put it to dynasty. Where they decide we're not gonna give them money. Or no, they did and it ruined them. Like did you guys, you guys haven't done an episode on TCI, John Malone, KDT. That's like, that will happen this year. So you know why? That was one of the books that was recommended the most. They're like, you gotta do cable cowboy, you gotta do cable cowboy, you gotta do cable cowboy. We both have read the book, it's awesome. It's excellent. And there's, so you know the story I'm about to tell you where the crazy thing is like, I'm always thinking about, I didn't understand this before studying, dedicating my life to studying history, right? Where it's like, oh wow, the decisions I'm making now can reverberate through the generations. That's a crazy thing where if Bob Magnus, which is the founder of TCI, you know, he doesn't have any monies and rural Texas wants to do this, jump into this new industry cable, right? Full of cowboys, little cowboys. And he doesn't have money, so his dad gives him a $2,500 loan. So Bob takes that $2,500 loan and then, let's say 40 years later, Bob dies and he's gotta pass on his money, right? That was created from the company he created to his two kids and he winds up giving them, I think, I don't know the numbers, I wanna say like 200 million each. Two sons. So think about that one decision, I think I talked about in the episode, and if I didn't, it's a big mess up on my part. And I stopped in that part of the book. I'm pretty sure you did. I was like, hold on. Think about that. Like what if his dad didn't give him the 2,500? Yeah, he's talking about that. Yeah, so his $2,500 turns into 400 million, let's say 200 million each for his grandsons. Changed his grandsons' lives. Right, so that means, rule of thumb, you take like, I don't know, you probably have three more generations after that of wealth guaranteed before they. And then the wealth is gone because I think it went up their nose. That's pretty hard in one generation. I don't know, the point was, that wasn't good for them because they were not motivated, they did a bunch of drugs, I think they went to jail, that kind of stuff, and you see that so much. So my thought was like, oh, get them a little bit, but not enough that they don't have to work or whatever, and Charlie's like, they're gonna hate you. Yeah, that's such a good, it's like. It's just like human nature. This is my biggest takeaway from Charlie, and I think the biggest benefit that people that listen to founders and acquired and then hopefully read a bunch of the books and do studying on their own are gonna realize, this is like, Charlie, I said it at the top of my notes, and this is the first thing, this is like, it's comforting. The conversation I had with Charlie was comforting the same way that people tell me listening to founders is comforting, is like, Charlie has an almost complete indifference to problems. Troubles, from time to time, should be expected. This is inescapable, so why would you let it bother you? And the difference, and if you think about, that's the main takeaway from this three hour dinner I had with him, right? And if you think about how does he avoid this, he avoids it by great things have less problems. You're never gonna escape problems, but if you're around great people, they're not gonna throw up, just like a great business doesn't throw up big problem after big problem after big problem, your wife, your kids, your friends, your coworkers, his whole thing is aimed for the highest quality you can get, and then that's gonna solve 99% of your problems, and then when you have the problem, you're never gonna come, okay, you're just doing it. He talked about when he lost the money on Alibaba, he brought that up, that people try to make fun of him for, or whatever, it's like, you guys are missing the point, you're not gonna escape, get through life without making mistakes. The founder of IKEA has this great quote where he says, making mistakes is the privilege of the active, only those asleep make no mistakes. The version of the man in the arena. Yeah, the Teddy Roosevelt. Okay, so what do you think is the ideal way to handle it if at 35 someone becomes very wealthy, and so when their kid's memory starts around age three, so for their entire kid's memorable lifetime, they've grown up in wealth and privilege, how does one handle that? I have no idea, I have no idea. Me even giving an answer to that is like, there's this guy named Charles Kettering, I don't know how to pronounce his name. I read his biography, I think it's episode 127 or something like that, so he invented the electric starter, he founded AC Delco, that gets acquired by GM. He is the head of research and development at GM when GM is the most valuable company, and the cutting edge of technology company in the world at the time. There's a story from his wife and his daughter in that book saying, hey, when he dies, there's only gonna be three words on his tombstone, on his tombstone, I don't know. Because that's what he would say over and over and over again. He's having this conversation, same thing, he was the son of a poor man, he is now a rich man, his kids are rich, he's talking to other people that have the same experience, his peers, like what do you do? And the answer they came up with, I don't know. Because it's so dependent on who the person is. Maybe you give them money going to Bob Magnus' grandsons, maybe they're like Warren Buffett's kids, where they run foundations, and they wanna give the money away, and I don't think they're coke addicts, I don't know. But it's just dependent on the person. If there was a simple, if there was a correct answer, I think some of these guys would have figured it out. Well, that's the thing about humans, right? Every person is different. Yeah, yeah, so I have no idea. Really, and that's the biggest thing, where I think this is one of the lessons I learned from the podcast, where you mentioned this at the beginning, Ben, where most of these people are just so, they're like best in class in this one dimension in the world, and of course, to get that, they had to be, they couldn't optimize all other areas of the life at what they did for their work, right? Sam Walton's one of the rare guys where he gets to the end, he knows he's dying, because he's got cancer all over his body when he's writing that book. And he's like, listen, if I could do everything again, he's like, yeah, I missed some of my kid's childhood, they worked in the stores, and he took them with him, but he's like, I'd do it again. I had to do this, I had to get after it, I had to improve. A lot of them get to the end of their life, and like, oh, I regret. The founder of IKEA has the best words on this. He said, I had three sons growing up, he started IKEA when he was like 17, worked on it until he was like 80 something, and he's like, I sacrificed my three sons' childhoods, I regret it, he goes, anybody that has kids knows that childhood does not allow itself to be reconquered. And so we were hanging out today, we were gonna do a recording, go to dinner, my plan was, I wanna see my son, and my daughter, it's like, I'm gonna take the red eye. And then I realized, yeah, but I wanna spend time with David and Ben, so I'm leaving early tomorrow morning, but it's like, I'm doing this as fast as possible, and if I had to, I'd fly back and forth, because your kids are, think about the relationship you guys have with your parents, are they still alive? Yep, yep. Okay, so you get to talk to them, see them, but you have your whole life, right? When your kids are small, there's this tiny window when they're like two to five to six, where you're everything to them. You and I have talked about it, I absolutely feel this way. Even my 10 year old daughter, like right now, she wants to spend time with me, it was the cutest thing ever, I was leaving, going to LA to see Charlie, and then coming up to San Francisco to see you guys, and she texts me, she goes, I'm wearing your sweater, because it makes me feel close to you, like while you're gone, you know what I mean? But if you ask her, do you wanna spend movie night with dad and mom, or do you wanna go play Roblox with your friends? Every day. For sure the latter. They're friends, and she loves me, don't get me wrong, but their friends are really important to them. Where every day I miss, my son's about to turn three, it's like, I'm not gonna get back that day, and there's only like a thousand of those days. And my wife won't have any more kids, even though I was like, I don't want a bunch of kids. Like once I was like, Charlie, I don't want a bunch, and she's like, no way, I don't have to get pregnant, so that's fine. Something that Buffett and Munger did with the Gram group that was way ahead of its time, that now anybody can do, is they formed their social networks outside of geographic barriers, and they found their most compatible, most like-minded, highest level of talent, peers, and then they just got on planes and got to go see them. That was really hard to do back in the day, and now anybody can do it. It's kind of like the Bill Gurley, you have no excuse not to do that. You also, but here's the thing, what people get wrong, is they're like, oh, I wanna meet this guy. You have to do the work necessary to make them worth your time, right? Which is like the unfair advantage that the three people sitting in this room have, is that it doesn't matter, that's why, in the last six weeks, I've gone to lunch or dinner with multiple billionaires, and the people that you get to talk to, and also this stuff, this dude is crazy. He's read 300 biographies of entrepreneurs, there's no way I'm gonna have dinner with him and not pick up one idea. And then now I've built this machine where, oh, that's an interesting idea, I'll just plug it into this business. It's not a financial transaction by any means, but there's no, the reason it's not that, Charlie was the first person I met that I was actually nervous about, and it's the reason I'm not nervous is because I know I've done the work. You can't put me in a room with anybody on the planet, and I'm not gonna be able to tell them at least one interesting thing. It doesn't mean I'll be the most, the best dinner they've ever had in their life, that's not what I'm saying, it's just like, they're gonna hear something that's like, oh, that's interesting, and goes through their own brain. And it's only because I've spent six years, and same with you guys, it's like, oh, you should feel comfortable, like you guys mentioned earlier, it's like, your audience feels like two football fields, and like, oh, it's a little bit of like, you didn't use the word insecurity, but like, you know, a little nervousness, I want these people to like me, it's just like, do you know? It's like a fear pushing you from behind. But you know, like, you've most likely read, you know more about the subject than they do. Sure, I do, but I need to make something worthy of their time. Yes, that is admirable. It's like, who cares, I could spend all the time in the world and fail to synthesize the narrative and the takeaways, and all of a sudden then I've just, you know, then I failed them, regardless of how much work I did, the product wasn't good. So that's the thing. It's hard to not have the product be good because you did the work, I guess is my point. Yeah, I think we now have a process that means that when you and I put in the work, the product is good, but it took a long time to arrive at that. It's almost like, you know, this is another Sam Hanke thing, trust the process. Yep. That was chapter. The point I was making there though is, because you guys do so much preparation and it's now your life's work, it's gonna be so hard not to add value to the people in your life, whether it's friends that never show up on a podcast or friends that you don't have a business relationship with, and you're just gonna add value because what you do is so rare. Neval Ravicon, he's influenced my thinking a lot too, and he has this thing in the Aminak and Neval by our friend Eric Jorgensen, and he's just like, if you read an hour a day, that puts you in the .0001% of humans. And I'm like, that can't be true. That's the dirty secret of acquired and founders is that people don't read books, so if you just read them and then tell people what's in the books, you're gonna 100x the market for books. And I couldn't believe that. I was having dinner with the same friend that was telling me, like I told him, I'll try to build a business around my reading. This is like a couple months ago. And he's like, you vastly overestimate how much people read. He goes, how many books a year do you think the average person reads? I was like, I don't know, 12? It's one. It's like .5. Zero. I remember asking a book publisher, and he said, America reads a book a year. Well, he quoted some other study. I said 12. He's like, no, not 12. He's like, it's zero. The average is zero. It's crazy. And yeah, to your point, I've become friends with a bunch of writers, some of them I met through the podcast, and they've been telling me, teaching me about the publishing industry, and just breaking down. 98% of books ever published sell less than 5,000 copies. It's parallel, everything. The book business is the venture business, which is so interesting to me how the advance model works. It's quite similar to a seed financing. I mean, they put out $50,000 for an advance on your book, which covers your cost of living while you're writing it, and they kind of don't care about recouping it because it's even worse. The whole business is about, did I sign up James Clear this year? And you know when you have Michelle Obama on your hands and you have to pay for it, but you don't know when you have a James Clear on your hands, and when that becomes the book that America reads this year, you better make sure it's in your publishing house and not one of the other three big, or four big, whatever it is, publishing houses. Seed funding is better, because their advances are recoupable. I was having this long conversation. It's the most preferred stock. Yeah, we were talking before. It's participating preferred. We were talking before we started recording. I was like, man, Jimmy Sony would be great to do a session with just because he's got this historical knowledge of PayPal, PayPal being so important to Silicon Valley history, and we were talking about this, and he's like, no, I have to pay that back through sales. I'm like, oh! Because the thing is, going back to, you guys listen to GameCraft, Blake Robbins. Oh yeah, every episode. So excellent. Unbelievably good. And what I loved about it is how they focused on the business model innovations and how one decision by some random group of programmers in the 1980s affected a business model decision 10 years later, whatever. And I was talking to Jimmy about this, and he goes, books are fantastic. They're the best products in the world. There's a great quote in Poor Charlie's Almanac, which says that there's ideas worth billions in a $30 history book. For Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, that is literally true, right? And what I don't understand is, you guys have such a high-value product, and you haven't innovated on the business model at all. And so I was telling Jimmy, I was like, do you know the deal? Like, think about this like an entrepreneur. Like, you're not a writer, you're an entrepreneur, and your product just happens to be a book. But you can make money off that any kind of way you want. Like, you can just get creative. I go, people think it's crazy where I'm like, I'm trying to be the Jay-Z of podcasts, and people are like, what the hell is wrong with you? And I did, like, that episode. Have you done episodes on Jay-Z? That episode I did on Jay-Z's autobiography is one of my most popular. People listen to it two, three, four, five times. I love Jay-Z, and I love you, I can't believe I haven't listened to that episode. Jay-Z has the founder mentality, and he had it since he was a kid. 100%. And you just see everything his whole career. And people look at him and be like, oh, this is another thing about, intelligence manifests itself in vastly different ways. It's not always credentialed, in many cases it's not, right? But Jay-Z's a straight-up genius if you listen to him and what he did. And he looked at it, he's like, yeah. He says it from the get-go. He's like, I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper. He's like, I'm a businessman, and rap just happens to be my product. And so I'm gonna think about it like that. I go, Jimmy, you should do that. Why don't you just find a deal like Jay-Z did with Samsung? He's like, what are you talking about? Well, that's true founders, entrepreneurs, whatever, founders in your case, in the title you wanna put them. They care about ownership. They own their work. And you realize that the business model matters, which is why I brought up GameCraft. So what Jay-Z did, this is years ago. This is his Magna Carta Holy Grail, probably came out 2013. So he goes, he goes, I could record this album, and then I could sell normal. I could stream it and then sell it for $10. You want the physical copy, et cetera, et cetera. He goes, what if I just want my money guaranteed? So he goes to Samsung and says, Samsung, you're launching this new app, this new phone, and you have your own app on it. I'm gonna sell you, I will sell you a million copies, $5 each. You give me $5 million guaranteed from an album. I'm still gonna own it, so he gets a streaming app. He goes, and so what I'll do is you pay me $5 million. The first million people that get access to my album are gonna be Samsung, whatever phone was coming out. You download it for free if you have this device. And so it's advertising to the Samsung, and it's guaranteed money at hand. I go, dude, you're writing about technology founders. I was like, there's these venture capital funds that have $80 billion of assets under management. Just like, hey, will you pay me $1 million to write this book? And then you say, hey, this book is now presented by whatever firm. This is why me and you, us two have talked about this privately. You guys already know this. It's like, there's been like, it's only like 15 acquisition or investment offers for founders, I said no to every single one. A lot of them are like this, where it's like, oh, well, you have the attention of people that are valuable. You just said the worst thing that can happen to a venture firm is they miss the hit of that. So they have to expand. They have to make sure they catch that, right? So it's like, hey, we'll pay for founders or whatever, give you X amount of money, pay you to do it. You do exactly what you do. The only difference is, essentially, they're trying to buy up our inventory forever. It's like, hey, founders is presented by X company. If you're gonna raise money, email here. And the response I have when I get these pitches is like, if I did that, that means I'm not actually learning the lessons in the books, which is like, you never give up control. It's like, no, why would I ever do that? Let's dive into a deal structure on that. So what if they weren't, what if you weren't giving up control, and what if you weren't giving up economics forever? You're just doing a period of time buyout of all your ad inventory. This is the intelligent thing. This is what Tegas is doing with Invest Like the Best. And this is why, it's crazy to me when I talk to people and they don't understand this. I had a conversation with a founder, and he's like, it's really weird, I'm not gonna say who it was. He's like, it's really weird that this company is running ads on that podcast every single episode forever. And I'm like, not at all. And I go, oh, see. I go. Moving parade, not standing on me. I go, David O'Greve ran the same exact ad in the same magazine for 30 years, and it was still effective. And so I went, I was like, what do you think Coca-Cola's been doing for 100, this is not new ideas. I think Coca-Cola is really dumb, or. Exactly. And I don't think they're dumb. Apple has the prime billboard in every major city in America to advertise whatever the latest iPhone is. Forever. Forever. So I talked to Michael Elnick, who's the co-founder of Tegas. And he's an, oh yeah, we all know each other. Great team. And we talked about this. And this is another example, because this somewhat affects our business, because when there's a decline in overall economics, ad markets usually shrink a little bit, and ad rates come down, and it's like, oh, you're doing exactly what investors do. Yeah. Like, what do Charlie and Buffett do when there's a crash? They don't, deploy, deploy. You read Izzy Sharpe's fantastic autobiography, the founder of Four Seasons, right? And he says this, he goes, he's building what didn't exist at the time, the only chain of five-star hotels at the time. And he says, I grow, and this is every founder does, it's Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Clay Frick, when they have recessions, that's when they grow. So what he would do is, in case competitors would pull back on advertising, he would spend more. And he says, he claims, I think in the book, he increases market share by like 25 or 28% using this over and over again, because human nature is, oh crap, things are small, and they cut. This is what Ogilvy said. Ogilvy's like, if you need advertising to sell your product, it's not a marketing expense, it's a production cost. It's actual cost of manufacturing your product. And so what Tegas, what Michael Eldenick did that was such a genius move, was, first of all, he knew something was working, right? And he scaled up through podcast ads. And he knew it was effective, and then he's like, oh, okay, well now you have all these people in the tech industry, their stock's creating, everybody's running in the street. What does he do? He goes like, oh, calls it. There's probably available inventory. And so he goes, hey, Colossus Network, I'd like to buy up every single ad inventory for 2023 on every single one of your shows. That's how you know the likelihood that guy's gonna win. I don't know the details of his business, it's private and everything else, it's like, that's the right decision. The same decision. That's what Ogilvy would have done. That's what Buffett and Munger do when they put money in. That's what Coca-Cola does. It doesn't matter the economic climate. You ever gonna see less Apple billboards? You're gonna see less Coca-Cola? No. It's interesting to think about this in the venture business, right? Which obviously, as we record this here in mid-March 2023, there's a lot going on in the venture business. It's so dynamic right now that I feel like we don't know the last two iterations of what have happened because we've been recording and I haven't checked my phone. That's how fast the world is moving right now. Things are happening very quickly as we speak. But I think a consequence of that, to your point about you should advertise heavier during recessions, I think customer differentiation among venture firms is just declining rapidly. What is... Well, no, it was until interest rates went up. But now that capital is scarce again. I think both the up and the down cycle is both, I think, are commoditizing. I totally disagree with this. I think when capital was a commodity and money was free, it was extremely hard to differentiate yourself as a venture firm or any financial firm. But it should be easier than ever to differentiate yourself because the thing... Okay, so how do you differentiate yourself right now? You guys are doing it. You can, I mean, well, one of them, let's abstract away speaking to the acquired audience as one of them or as a gigantic means of differentiation. Well, let's just say you're XYZ average friendship firm out there. Having money and writing the checks. But yes, having money, right? But like... A year from now, it's like six to 12 months from now, that's gonna be differentiating. So I have a thought on this. One, I don't know anything about venture investing. Two, I don't know anything about investing, period. Like I get to talk to super smart investors and I'm sure the questions are like, hold on, you had to find that for me. And I'm sure they're like, this kid's an idiot. But when you guys were talking a little bit about your business and the venture game in general, is I just think of what one of my favorite things that I heard Jeff Bezos say is, for years, people were like, hey, when are you gonna do physical retail? When are you gonna do physical retail? When are you gonna do physical retail? And he says something that was crazy. Physical retailing is an ancient business. I love that term, it's an ancient business. So I'm not gonna do it until I know, it's so hard to improve on an ancient industry. It has to be completely differentiated. You mentioned, I heard you on one of your podcasts where you went to the Amazon Go store just as like pure curiosity. It's not like you needed something. And so you guys have probably read that story too, where it's like at one time they were gonna do like meat and all this other stuff that you'd have to talk to somebody. He's like, no, you have to redo this. This doesn't make sense. The key, the differentiation here is that you walk in, you walk out. Not walk in, talk to some guy, he's like cutting salami for you. You gotta get that out of there. And so I've had this thought, because I've read a bunch of biographies on investors too, and like investing is an ancient business. We're just doing it in different ways now. And so I was like, well, if you wanted to invest, right, let's say you wanted to invest in private companies, which people have been doing forever. I always think of like, where did JP Morgan get his deal flow? And you know, like you've read through the history. It's like, people are like, oh, that was JP Morgan Bank. Like, no, there's no retail bank. Like you're not going in there. There's no ad like a sign on the door. It's like, here's JP Morgan Company. It's like, it was a relationship based. It's like you got in if you knew somebody, right? I read this biography that's incredible. I highly recommend people read it. It's episode 103 of Founders. It is the richest woman in America, heady green, I can't remember the subtitle. I love how he denies that he knows every number of every episode and then busts out three more. It's only cause I like reference this all the time. So heady green, right? It's only because you reference every episode all the time. One day it's just gonna be a recording of just all the episode numbers. But heady green. You are an algorithm. You are your read wise app. That's how I get it. So the heady green though was so wealthy that she bailed out the city of New York. Like that book has unbelievable stories. This is, I've never heard this person's name and they bailed out the city of New York. So the richest, when she was alive, the richest city in the world per capita was like New Bedford, Massachusetts. Oh yeah, whaling. Bingo. So her family made so much whaling and the way they looked at the family fortune is I am a steward of this money. My job is to make it grow so that the next generation has more. And then she's like the third generation of these whaling. And then whaling, it died out, I think the generation before her. So they had to figure out how to make money. The technology stocks of her day, railroads. She made a ton of money in railroads and then she'd buy land, real estate in New York and everything else. But anyways, my point being, and I had this conversation with Patrick one day. I was like think about it. That was an ancient, investing is an ancient business so you wouldn't do what heady green did. Where did she get her deal from? People knew her, they knew she was wealthy. They knew that she was the first person to go to in financial panics. They called financial panics what we call recessions and depressions now. And it was like every three years back then. And so what she would do is she had a desk in chemical bank in Manhattan. So the advantage there is geography. Physical location, you're at the center of finance in America, you need to be here, you build a reputation. So literally there are stories in the book where there'd be a line of people in financial crashes waiting for her desk. She's like okay, I'll save my road stocks, pennies on the dollar. Cornelius Vanderbilt did the same thing. She invested with him and a bunch of other people. And I was like, but what would you do today? You want an edge. Everything we're talking about, you need an edge. You can't play, Ed Dorp has the great quote in his book. He's like I've been a money manager for 50 years. One thing I know is the surest way to get rich is only play games and make investments where you have an edge. Which is another way of saying do something your competitors don't, aren't, or can't. Or Edwin Land. So Edwin Land plays a huge role in my life. Founder of Polar Rights, Steve Jobs Hero, because he said I have a personal model, it may not fit anybody else, don't do anything somebody else can do. And so I was like, okay, I don't think anybody else could do founders the way I do it, so I'm just gonna do this, right? So my point being is how would you do it today? Well, you would, it would look very much like what I think you guys are building. And I'm not an investor, so I don't know anything about your world, but it's just like I'd spend my time reading and learning about business history. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett did that. Every single investor you guys have probably read about does that all the time. They read constantly, right? I would share what I know. That's gonna build my network of other people. Those people are eventually gonna get so many deals. Then I have this huge advantage that you couldn't even do 15 years ago because there's no such thing as a podcast, right? It's like now I can record all the stuff I'm learning, right? Which we should say there have been iterations of this. This is how Union Square Ventures became Union Square Ventures. Our Foundry Group became Foundry Group. Because blogging, and then Brad and Jason writing the book on venture deals. I mean, it's like this- Venture hacks with Naval and Rivy. Totally. I have two other examples. It's not even venture. Like what is the most successful content marketing of all time? Michelin? No, Berkshire shareholder letters. Totally, of course. Berkshire shareholder letters. Because this is how you know Jesus is a genius. It is the greatest act of salesmanship because you never even see the sale happening. It's like, hey, and they spend, you know, you guys have probably done this research, how much time they spend on those letters. It's like half a year, seven, eight months for every letter. This is not like, oh, I just jot it down on what I learned this year. And the crazy thing is like he's- Old like a Warren. How many people have, this is something Charlie taught. Oh, so this is a great thing that this came up here. Did you talk about the letters with him? No, I asked him about like, so I was explaining to him, I was like, Charlie, I'm literally in the middle of like reading about you when you were like around my age. So every time I read a book, I'm like, okay, first of all, I know what year they're born. So every time as I go through the books, I'm like, how old are they? And I write down, okay, he's 24 here. I wanna know what they were doing in and around my age. And so I was like, Charlie, I'm thinking about you guys. Like you just started, like your fund starts to be like 41 or something like that. I don't remember what it was, right? And I was like, then like 50, like you start out, you're trying to figure things out. You could see them kind of figuring out, making the mistakes. You guys did an excellent job on your episode, like talking about what they learned from, getting to like get away from the Ben Graham, like get to one excellence. Great businesses are rare, we should be in there. And then just let time do all the work. And I was like, and now like you guys put up the greatest investment record the world's ever seen. It's like, are you surprised? He goes, of course. He's like, of course I'm surprised. Like, how could you not be? Like we wanna be successful. We were ambitious and driven, but there's no way you could say, hey, I'm gonna be worth, what's Berkshire's market cap right now? I don't know, like 500 billion? Yeah, whatever it is. But he said, but the reason that popped to my mind when I was asking him like these questions, let me actually get the exact note because I don't wanna mess up the way he said it because his lines were just excellent. And so he goes, he's surprised how successful him and Warren turned out, but how could you not be surprised? And then he said something that was fascinating. He goes, I think we get too much credit. I was like, whoa, that's interesting. Like, why do you think that, Charlie? And he's like, it's very, he goes, I find it odd to be so wealthy and loved. That's not, these are not exact words. These are my interpretation of his words. Let me just be clear here. I find it so odd that to be wealthy and loved, that's not a usual human reaction. And then my note tied to why I think the Berkshire Letters are the greatest content marketing real-time. He goes, and I go, I wonder if this is because they spent so much time teaching others. So what is, when you listen to Choir, you guys are teaching, right? Berkshire, I'm gonna go to Paul Graham too. Berkshire, they're teaching, like, you could just not read a book and just read Berkshire's letters and you're gonna get a fantastic education, right? And then in there is like, oh, by the way, we'd like to be the buyers of choice. So if you happen to know of this business, like this business that you wanna get your hands on, and you care about it, and you do this excellent product differentiation, call me. The greatest content, what is, how much money do they make off of that? And obviously. And I think this is probably, I don't even know if it's on the list of things that they care about, but it's also marketing for their businesses. Totally. I have Geico car insurance because it's a Berkshire Hathaway company. This is how we talked, I'm drinking these. I feel an extra kinship for Brooks running shoes. Absolutely, I'm wearing Brooks right now. Okay, so I changed out, I was in a Polo hoodie right before it came over. I watched a documentary on Ralph Lauren. I just did a podcast. I just listened to your episode. Yeah, I think it's episode 288. I wonder if I'm right. There it is again. Let's see if I'm right though. Let's see if I'm right. I could be wrong, I could be full of crap. It's 288. Okay. So, but before that, I had watched a documentary on him, like years ago, and I found out that he did the, I always go to Ben for the proper pronunciation. Like we'll do the same podcast. I will, I say like Akio Morita, and then he's like, Akio Morita. I'm like, all right. I go with Ben. I go with Ben. Oh, you get the, I will give you the correct American pronunciation. It's unclear if it's actually right or not. So he did the same thing that Akio did, you know, like they were struggling in the early days of Sony. They get this huge order, like we're gonna take 100,000 units or whatever it is, but take off Sony and put on our name. And Akio's like, we have no money, but he refused to do that. Cause like, I'm not building your company and building mine. I love that, like that entrepreneurial, like bullheaded Tennessee. Same thing with Ralph. Ralph was broke. Him and his wife are living in a house, our apartment with a train running over on top of them. They're sleeping on a mattress and he's making ties and Bloomingdale's like, well, take them. We love them. Take that name off. You're gonna be our house brand. And he's packs up his ties. He's like, I'm not here to build your brand. I'm here to build mine. Like that, so that, what you're hearing that- It's funny because later in life, like he would make so much money on just licensing out his brand. He's like, I don't even make any of the products. I'd literally just license the brand. Hearing that made me buy more polo clothes. Hearing your affinity for Geico makes you buy Geico. The advertisers you have in acquired because they love you, your audience, if you, I know you guys vet them and like, you have a ton of people that want to advertise that you don't let. It's like, your relationship, that goodwill that you're building up, the goodwill that Buffett built up. Another, the second maybe most- And by the way, there's a litmus test for that. It's does the acquired Brit, like I want to only work with sponsors that I wanna so full throatedly endorse that I feel the acquired brand gets stronger by working with them. And like, if you can actually just keep doing that durably, I think that is like an amazing way to build a brand. And you know, we try, it doesn't always work. And sometimes we just don't sell ad slots because we're like, well, the bar's here. Long-term, like, okay, I miss a week on advertising. It doesn't matter, I'm doing this for- When we get on the phone, the first time we ever talked, do you guys love podcasting? I love podcasting, you're gonna do it forever? We're gonna do it forever. We say the same thing. It's like one week, you know, we could do this for another 40 years. So the same thing, it's like the same goodwill that you're talking about. It's why I'm drinking, I don't even drink energy drinks. Right? But like the format for founders- You showed up with five Jaco goes. This is the only energy drink I found and I only found it because the, I was driving home on Thanksgiving and all the coffee shops are closed and I heard Jaco's podcast and I know he has this and he says, he's in Wawa's. And I was like, wait, there's a Wawa on the turnpike. I was like, I can just go there, like they're there. And I bought them and I was wired for the whole drive home. I was like, oh, they work, man, this is fantastic. But the point there is like, it's not like when I went to the energy drink aisle, I was like, oh, maybe I'll do Rockstar or Monsters. Like, no, they didn't make a podcast that I love. Jaco made a podcast I love. You were not evaluating energy drinks at that point. The format for our founders I got from Jaco, I found his podcast because he was on Tim Ferriss's. His podcast at the very beginning was just him reading books for an hour, hour and a half saying, oh, I like this section. Yeah, and he does it for autobiographies for military people. And I was like, oh, I should do this for autobiographies of founders and everything else. So it's a combination of ideas. The second best version, you guys know this more than me because it's your world and I don't know anything. I had spent three weeks reading Paul Graham's essays. Paul Graham's essays changed my life. Also, content marketing. Yeah, everyone. Totally changed my life. So we're gonna get there. The full, the reason to finally jump and dedicate my life to founders came, my wife was sleeping in bed next to me, I'm up late at night. I read Paul Graham's essay, How to Do What You Love. I talk about this on some episode 275, 76 and 77. Those are right, I know that for sure. Are the three Paul Graham episodes I did. I talk about this snap, how he changed, that episode changed my life or that essay changed my life in 275. So then I'm, so I spent three weeks going through every single one of his essays. So something his new essays lack that they had before, so he used to have this bright orange box at the top. It says, do you wanna start a startup? Apply to Y Combinator. Apply to Y Combinator. And so I was like, think about, so again, it's not like you went, I thought about this, what is the founders version of Y Combinator? What is the acquired version of Y Combinators? You have to be very careful who you partner with and what you're doing. So I was like, what is the orange box? It's not like you go to Paul Graham's and he's got 10 banner ads. He's just like, no. Yeah, he worked for Yahoo, he knows that doesn't work. Your attention is here. And it's like, he didn't know that starting Y Combinator, you can go back and read his essays about it, watch his interviews. They had no clue. Just like Charlie told me. He's like, no, I did not expect to build one. It was called the summer founders program. You know, it wasn't even. That's the best thing about learning about the company and founder history. It's like, there's no way when you could interview Sam Walton when his shoes, the bottom of his shoes has watermelon and donkey crap. He's not gonna be like, hey guys, I'm the richest man in the world. And so I love this idea of, hey, all of these discussions about the business benefit, all comes from, it's the byproduct of educating people, sharing people. That's why people love Charlie and Warren, why all three of us love him. How much have us three learned from him, them? So much. Yeah, to the point where like, it's such a good point. He taught America. I wanted to cry when I met him. Because of their content marketing. I mean, it sounds straight, but like. His lessons changed my life. They're gonna change the trajectory of my kids' lives. Like that is, and you know, he probably hears that a million times a day, but it doesn't matter. It's like, I got a chance to tell him that. That's it. It is crazy. He educated America on investing while still managing to do it better than anyone else. There was some funny things about that too, where he says like, you know, they get, he says something like, well, you know, they're completely, he says, you both, in your episode, you talk about Snowball. Snowball has that quote from Buffett in there. He talks about it's really important to have an inner score card or an outer score card. Inner score card is his dad. It's like, I'm doing this because I know it's good. Outer score card is like, I'm doing this. What are the people gonna think about me? Newsflash, no one's thinking about you. They think about themselves. So outer score card people cannot have, like it's almost really hard to have a happy life having an outer score card. I like Charlie's description of that better. He says, like, I think it was Andrew that asked him the question. Maybe Chris asked him a question. It's like, were you like, were you driven to succeed like to impress your dad or your mom? It's a great question. He goes, no. He goes, I had an inner clock. He goes, I have an inner clock and I always had an inner clock. I did this because I wanted to do it. And he goes, and they're like, do you think Buffett's like that? He goes, Buffett has an inner clock too. And it's just like this idea where they did it their way, regardless, they don't care what other people think. He said this about the fact that they keep some of their wholly owned businesses and like, oh, the profits are less or they kind of just let them run out. And like, they'll just keep the cash. And then people are like, oh, you should invest the cash. And he's just like, no, because we're opportunists. We're individual opportunity driven is the line that he has about that. Right. You were going somewhere, David, earlier with the discussion of being a professional investor and how it's less differentiated than it's ever been before. Well, where I was going with it was, I bet, look at the reaction on Twitter and elsewhere and I think in much of the country to what's happened with the Silicon Valley Bank situation. Not that this is a current events podcast, but like, it's also by the time this comes out, it's gonna be two weeks. It's gonna be old news, right? Hopefully things will just be calm and settled down and there'll be no more impending crises. Yeah, right. But another one's coming eventually. Right. Just like Charlie says, you're gonna have another unintended problem a year from now. Yep. I think you are right, Ben, that just having capital to invest will be differentiating going forward. However, I think the aggregate brand and reputation of the venture industry has taken a massive hit. Totally. Massive hit over the last several years. And you're not holding up SVB. And it just keeps going down. Your SVB is revealing to how other people think of Silicon Valley. What I'm specifically referring to is VC's behavior and reactions on Twitter over the past week, but that's just emblematic of the direction things have been going for years now. And part of it's related to tech in general, but I think there's a specific, maybe hatred is strong, but brand decline of the venture capital industry. Yeah, I agree with that. Tie it to differentiation among venture firms. So yes, as the market goes down, having capital will be differentiating and the number of participants will go down in the industry and whatnot. But how do you stand out in this market? If in aggregate your industry is thought less of and people don't wanna work with you, how do you turn that tide? Yeah, if the next Sam Walton has the opportunity to raise venture capital dollars and he's like, you know what, I think I would rather just figure it out another way and not build in that ecosystem. I think there are a lot of people out there right now who wanna start businesses and are like, I'm not gonna raise venture capital, because F that and I don't need to. And it was a lie that I needed to. Can I tell you from the founders perspective, because I talked to a ton of founders. I'm gonna go down, I think, hopefully we'll see, talking to more founders than any non VC. I get offers all the time like, hey, you wanna invest in my company? I've said no to all of them. Just because I'm like, dude, I'm focused on founders. I don't care about anything about my podcast. And so we have these conversations and it's just like, what VCs don't understand is how much founders hate them. They hate them and it's not they hate the good ones. They love the good ones. I'm not gonna say some of the brands that I've heard about, they're like, oh no, we raised money from a bunch of people. They're good, they don't mess with us, but if we ask a question or we need something, they jump on it. And the problem is it's a natural distribution of any industry. There's going to be crappy founders and great founders. There's gonna be crappy investors and great investors. And so I really think it ties back to the principle that Buffett and Munger built their business on, is only associating themselves with the best people and the best companies. And that solves so much of their problems. My issue is there's a lot of VCs in my audience too and they're nice people, don't get me wrong. Some of them I've talked to, it's just like, who gave you money to invest? What is going on here? But what I don't like is, the best ones, this is what I like about Patrick. If you talk to the people that Patrick has invested in, he doesn't say, here's a list of 10 things I took two minutes to think about. He's asking questions, he does exactly what he does on his show, he asks questions. And if you need something, I'll do whatever I can because he's got a good network and help. No, but he's certainly not, he's like, if I have to tell the founder what to do, then why did I invest in it? That doesn't make any sense. So what happens is I'll get these emails, like I love your show, et cetera, et cetera. Here's like 10 ideas for you. And it's just like you read them, it's like you hired an assistant or a researcher, maybe you wrote this yourself. You thought about this for 30 minutes. I think about this all day, every day. I've thought about this every day for years, man. That's not helpful. What are you doing? You're just making, I have a lower opinion of you because this is a dumb idea. And the only way to about that is, do you know who Bryce Roberts is? Yeah. Okay, so he has, this is, again, I've never raised venture capital, I've never made a venture capital investment, but I talked to a ton of founders and he has the greatest description. He's like, what is the product that founders are buying from VCs? It's not money, because everybody's got money. Well, it's used to have money. Or yeah, I guess it's used, but still, the VCs are good though, there's still a lot of people that have money. There's still gonna be investments made in markets. Compared to venture in the 70s, yes. He said two words, improved odds. That is the best, from a founder's perspective, that is the best description. It's like, if I take investment from you, as opposed to this other guy over here, this other girl over there, who's going to be, founders, all they care about is, can you help my company succeed? Is it more likely that my company succeeds? I'm dedicating my life to this, man. This is not a game. Can you make my company succeed? And sometimes you can do that money, sometimes you can network. There's other people sitting right across from me that could probably help with distribution, that is actually a value add. That is the difference. If I was gonna be a venture capitalist, and God knows I would not be, right? I would just start a podcast. And then I would do it for six years, and I would get really valuable, and then my inbox is full of people. I don't have deal flow. It comes inbound. I have a friend, Chris, Chris Powers. He syndicates real estate investment. Rich people like to invest in real estate. There's all these tax benefits. And he says, David, even with, this guy's done, I think, he's got either a billion or two billion dollars of industrial class real estate under management right now. And he's like, David, I just was interviewing and doing my podcast, again, same thing, educational, interviewing people operating in the real estate industry, and interviewing founders, and just doing it because he liked to do it, and he wanted to talk to this sort of people, happen to press record, put it out there, and never really promoted it. He's like, even with my small audience, he goes, I've raised, he goes, it changes the dynamic from, hey, I'm Chris, I'm sitting on outbound, hey, I'm Chris, this is what I do. This is like, can we talk? Can we set up a meeting to, oh, Chris, love your podcast. How can I get five million in your fund? It reverses it because they get to know you as a person. This is what I don't like also. It shortcuts the relationship. You just said, it's a relationship, right? Which I think there's too much of this calendar, like Tetris, that no offense, that venture capital's play, because they try to do it with me, where our founders do this too, where they're like, hey, love your show, love to get to talk to you. Can we talk? And I reply back, yeah, let's set something up. Then I get like, then I'm routed to an assistant, and then it's like, oh, you know. How about six weeks from now on Thursday? Joe Smoll has 30 minutes, three weeks from now, and I've done this once or twice, and now my response is, that's no way to build a relationship. Here's my phone number, just text or call me when you're free. I'm not a 30 minute block in your calendar. And dude, the inbound that all three get, it's like I'm already almost hitting a limit to how many deep relationships I can build. So I'd rather, instead of talking to a million, I'm not a fester, instead of talking to a million people for 15 minutes, I'd rather talk to five or 10 people over and over and over and over again. That's what Charlie and just, Charlie and- You've talked a lot about this, and you've rubbed off on me a lot on this. I have changed my mindset and my daily life, and I've changed my daily behavior hugely because of our conversations. Charlie and Warren, it's like they build relationships, they found people they like, admired, and trust, they repeat like, admire, and trust over and over again in the letters and their talks, and then they just did business with them forever. It's not this wide but shallow, and that's where you get the bad behavior. And anybody that's high quality can see through it, and it's not gonna work with you. And you're only gonna succeed, like you guys, if your business is parallel, you're only gonna succeed if you get the very best ones. It's interesting though, like the, man, just like so much in life, Warren and Charlie really, they're just so often right. And if you think about, if you buy the premise that the aggregate opinion of the venture capital industry has declined a lot- It's meaningfully worse. And may continue to decline, whether it does or doesn't, it's meaningfully worse than it used to be. What have Warren and Charlie done? And to your point about the best content marketing ever, what is what they do? It's a combination of a hedge fund and a private equity firm. What is the aggregate opinion, public opinion of hedge funds, managers, and private equity firms over the last 50 years? Nothing but down. What is the aggregate opinion of Berkshire? Nothing but up, you know? It's amazing. This is one advantage that I have, the fact that I'm not an investor, so I don't have to keep up on like, to some degree, venture capitalists have to like know what's going on, right? And I close myself off. Like I was having dinner with Sam and his wife, and they're asking me, like his wife was asking me like, hey, do you know about this person? Oh no, do you know about this? I think, and Sam's like, he's got a very limited like, he said it nicely, he's like, you can ask about like books, but this dude's not watching TV, he's not doing any of the other stuff, right? We keep him in a, you know, hut out back. And the good thing about that though is somebody actually, so essentially the way I use like Twitter or any social media is like, I put out little snippets from my podcast in text. You put out a lot on Twitter. In text though, for him, right? Yeah. Which has been really working for you. I was like, I'm gonna read something that has a million, over a million views in 24 hours, because everything's going on, and because I just had dinner with Charlie. So I'm gonna read this and then I'll go back to the benefit. This is an amazing tweet, by the way. So I go, Charlie Munger tells a story about human nature. Now, I didn't put this because of the bank run. Like I was just thinking, I was like, oh, this is, I was reading your highlights. Wait, you didn't post this, like with regards to the bank run? No, no. Remember I reread my highlights every day? Yeah. And so when I read my highlights, well my Twitter is like, when I reread highlights, like, oh, that's a good one, I just put it on Twitter. Oh my God, then you have like just the greatest timing in history. Yeah, exactly. Well, like it wasn't intentionally, I knew what was going on, but it never said, oh, let me, I need an SVB tweet. Like I don't have any money in SVB, like whatever. So it goes, Charlie Munger tells a story about human nature. And then this is all Charlie speaking. One of my favorite stories is about the little boy in Texas. The teacher asked the class, if there are nine sheep in a pen and one jumps out, how many are left? And everybody got the answer right, meaning eight, right? Except this little boy who said, none of them are left. And the teacher said, you don't understand arithmetic. And the little boy said, no teacher, you don't understand sheep. And so, so effing good. How, okay, when you were in the room with Charlie for several hours, how did like, in natural conversation, are they just pulling out these like parables and these fables, like, you know. Let me, I'm gonna ask that question. The best response to this tweet, I didn't even, I missed it myself. He goes, was the child Charlie himself? I'm like, oh my God, that's exactly what he would have done. He would have been the kid. Yeah, totally. He would have been the kid. So the reason I think it's so powerful, like the storytelling ability you guys have, how I try to break down things to aphorisms, you ask like, why is this guy on my phone, right? I only think in stories. I think people only learn through stories and then one-liners, right? That's why Charlie, why is Charlie, David Ogilvy. That idea, it's like, he says it in a creative way. And you remember Fer. Charlie Munger says, hey, if you don't learn probability, you're gonna go through life with a, as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. So good. So you laugh and then you think about it, and it's like, oh, what is it? It's so good. Oh, like, I'm gonna get my ass kicked. Like, so that's the way. This is here because it's Ernest Shackleton. His family motto was, by endurance, we conquer. So we're in the podcast business. People are like, you can't do podcasts. There's like two million of them. It's like, dude, there's like 70 or 80% of them that have quit. 98%. In the business podcast right now. Me and Patrick were just talking about this. I just saw him in person in Miami and we were talking and I showed him this. It's like, dude, for podcasts like Me and Patrick's and yours, business categorized in business, have at least 10 episodes and I think release at least once a week. You guys, I think, are really scheduled less than that. Right, two weeks? Every two or three. So those three categories is like. But in terms of minutes of content per week where we're the same as everybody else. But like that was one thing. Like they release once a week, right? 18,000. And the business category is the second most popular, the second most populated podcast category. Behind. Do you know the first? Spirituality. Faith. True crime has fallen off then. Yeah, thankfully. So I'm gonna start. So there's a thing about that where I heard somebody said they're like, founders is like church for entrepreneurs. And I might start dropping podcasts on Sunday and. No, no, I'm not kidding. And if I do video, I swear to God, I went and looked. I looked at pulpits. I was like, I'm not gonna get a. Oh, come on. I swear to God. I swear to God. You went crucifix shopping. I'm not gonna get a desk. Think about, my mom was like fundamentalist Christian stuff and like I had to go to church my whole life. And it's just like, this is pretty crazy. Like not in a bad way. I don't mean that the majority of us. Like they're learning from the same book every week over and over again. And the stories you can tell are limitless. It's one book. I can do the same thing I have access to all the books in the world. Like I can do that. So I do think there's an element of. Totally. Five years from now, people are gonna be like, this is the moment where David started the cult. Yeah. It's right here on video. We're documenting it. Cults are the best businesses though. 100%. If you listen to my episode in and out, episode 244. There's no way I got that right by the way. Oh, now we get to know. I did that. You keep talking. I'll look up if you got this right. I did that episode because. It's 244. Of course. Is it? Oh my God. I read that book because the best businesses in the world are cults. That's what the founder of Trader Joe's, he wrote his autobiography. He said that Trader Joe's was a cult for the overeducated and underpaid. Right. And it's not to say that like cults are amazing businesses. That's not what you're saying. You're saying the very best businesses. Are cheerful. Develop a cult. In and out calls them, they use this terminology in their business. Cheerful cult. It's a positive cult. I'm not talking about Jonestown, let's get together and freaking drink mass suicide. No, no, I'm talking things that, hopefully you're building a product that's good for the world. We had Gary Tan on back in the day and he was talking about Palantir at the very beginning and he was like, oh, Palantir was a cult. That's why it worked. Well, this idea also influenced me. It's zero to one, Peter Thiel's book. It's like, he says that. It's like the best businesses, startups look like cults. You have to inspire emotion in people. Otherwise, you can't stand out in the world and you certainly can't have repeat behavior and in a sea of choices for someone to keep choosing you over and over and over again. It's like how founders have to be weird. This is one of the big things. Nothing interesting was created by ordinary people. But I have to be intentional about this. I'm glad you said, oh, this is where we get in on camera and on recording that David is sort of cults. It's like, I go crazy. People start talking about me. A bunch of them say, David's too obsessed with podcasts. And I'm like, I'm glad they say that because even now there's- They're like, thank you, that's a compliment. No, it's like I see an opportunity that other people don't, which is the same thing in the book. So I think podcasts in general are just fun to make and I'm obsessed with it, but they're also gonna be wonderful businesses because they're prone to be cheerful cults. And how do you know that you have a cult? You just Google and see if the people have tattooed themselves with the brand. How many people are walking over with a Joe Rogan's face on his tattoo? Or a Joe Rogan face tattoo on their skin? A ton of them. Really? Yes. How many people have tattoos of the Apple logo? A ton of them. There's an insane number with Mario. We learned this in the Nintendo message. Mario, Tesla, In-N-Out. There's a ton of- Dude, I like, cheeseburgers are my favorite meal. I'm not tattooing an In-N-Out logo on my arm, dude. You take another level. And you see this over and over and over again. And so when I analyze businesses, I'm not just doing this, it's not a game to me. I was like, oh, can I use these ideas in building my business? And Warren Buffett says the greatest thing, and this I think speaks to why you guys are so like, hey, we know how big our audience is and we're gonna take this seriously. Seriously, Warren goes, a brand is a promise. That's the best description of a brand. It's just like, I talked about the fact that I stayed in this hotel brand, in Austin I loved it, I stayed in Santa Monica I loved it, I found out they had one in San Francisco. I didn't check the reviews. You came here and they broke their promise. I told you to stay with us. And that's the biggest thing, a brand was a promise. I know this is gonna be excellent. The hotel's fine, it is in like, it's in a tenor lorraine. It's like a- Not a place you wanna stay. No, if I wasn't traveling alone, there's no way I'd let my wife- This is the major misconception about San Francisco. Many people who don't live here think that it's an absolute hellhole in wasteland. A specific part of it is. But like, there are other parts- And that part grew a little bit. And unfortunately, that part is mostly where the hotels are. Yeah, which is not good for the city. No, it's terrible for the city. I'm not ever staying, I'm staying with you or I'd stay in, like I'd stay out in Silicon Valley. I've stayed at the Rosewood which is really nice. That is not the tenor lorraine. The most expensive hotel which is like good. I didn't pay for it, so. No one ever does. That's the whole business model. I didn't know how much it was. It was really nice though. I gotta thank that person. Yeah, so again, I don't mean it in like a, but I am very intentional. Like hey, I'm not gonna break my promise. I want you to know and you guys do the same thing. It's like if I press play on an acquired episode, this is why I like Dan Carlin is, I read one book an episode. He reads like 30. He only does two a year or one a year. One a year. But I know there's no way I'm gonna press play. It's gonna be good. And he didn't do the work necessary. That's what we feel. We all feel. I mean, yeah. In our own ways, we all definitely feel that about what we're doing. Can I get some feedback? Like how can we make acquired better? Or have you ever had moments where you like paused an episode and were like oh, I wanna like talk to Ben and David about this right now because like I have some feedback. No. You'd probably just text us if you did. No, but like I text, I would, first of all. Or the model, not just, not necessarily just the content, but like. No, what you guys said on your benchmark dinner episode I think was like you know. There's a few podcasters, I had this conversation with Sam yesterday. There's a few podcasters that like they know what they're doing. And they know what their position in the market is, like how they're thinking about it. And I'm not gonna say who. But like you guys hit it. Like what makes you special? It's the Edwin Land thing. Don't do anything somebody else can do. Right, where you say it's like your marquee thing is the super indebted. Blake made the funny, Blake Robinson said the funny thing on Twitter I saw. I loved it. He's like only acquired could say all right, let's bring this home and sell an hour and a half last. Yeah. That's your brand. People know it. Totally. Yeah, and I think what you're doing here with like the sessions is like a way to also, it's like there's no, you can't increase your, the amount of episodes that you can do because they take so much work to do. But you also have a way to surface all this information that you guys have that's valuable to other people in different formats. We were talking about this a little bit before, which I hate saying we were talking about this before we were recording. It's why didn't we just record? But you were also thinking about potentially doing something similar. Yeah. And there's like. Not now, but years from now. Yeah, but for the core episodes, we spend so much time preparing. But then for stuff like this, we don't prepare at all because our whole career is preparing. Does this make sense? Like what is the right number and format of sessions? Because this is the second session. We're still figuring sessions out. Like in your dream world as an acquired listener, what do sessions look like? I mean, your sessions should be, replace your interviews. Anything that's a non-acquired, long, deep time, just make them a session. There's enough people interviewing founders and investors. But we need more conversations. So if I ever did, people are like, if you ever do an interview show, I was like, first of all, I wouldn't do an interview show. Because interview is a skill. It looks easy. Like I always tell Patrick, Patrick, you're a world class at this, dude. Like you have, you wield. You've been on the show. Every week and now twice a week for eight, nine years. It's for, I like to read. He likes to ask questions. So therefore our formats match the personality, right? And so what I tell him is like, I've been on the other side of it. It's like, you can tell it's not, he doesn't have a list of questions in front of him because you can tell his good question just came off of response of what, like a lot of people like, and it's fine, but like the Tyler Cowan thing where he just like, he has his questions and you just say something interesting, he's not gonna follow up and he's gonna go on to the next question. It feels very odd because you're like, are you guys not having a conversation? Like that guy like left you an opening and how did you not take that opening? They're not. But Tyler, you have to do, let's tie this to Jay-Z and J. Cole and the answer question also about like, I'm glad you guys are so much nicer. We're like, do you have any feedback? Cause like, I can't stand feedback. We're like not in the sense of, like I told you, I text you guys this one time. We're like, one guy was like, hey, I don't like that you reference, like the super power of the show is that I tie, it's not like the episode on Ralph Lauren is gonna tell you how Ralph thinks like Andrew Carnegie and Rockefeller and Bezos. You literally know all your episode numbers by heart. So to me, it's just one large conversation on history of great entrepreneurs. That's how it is to me, it just happens to be separated. And so I text you and this guy's like, could you save that for at the end and just do it like a carve out like acquired? And I was like, don't listen to acquired. No, I'm not going to. I have a singular vision for how this is gonna go and that's why I own and control and operate the entire thing. It's even further than that. It's like, I'm not putting on a show. Like there's a lot, I loved Anthony Bourdain when he was alive, I read his books. He had a huge influence on me. Like anytime I traveled to a place that he went to, I'd go and watch it. Have you done an episode on him? Yeah, 219. There's no way that's right, there's no way. Keep going, there's no way that's right. Fact checkers. It's called the oral biography. That format should be done more where his assistant had interviewed, an assistant friend had interviewed a bunch of people who actually knew Tony and were there in his last days. And then she organized that interview into this biography called Bourdain, the definitive oral biography I think. And is it 219? It's 219. And so where was I going with that? I went on a digression. Oh, so there's a line in the book that I love. It says the line between Tony and his show is nonexistent. That's why people like, I hear a lot of people talk about podcasting. It's like, oh, you don't actually know what the superpower of podcasting is, right? Where it's like to me, one of the superpowers of podcasting is it's authenticity scaled, right? If when I meet with founders, I listen to founders, and we have a three hour dinner, they all say the same thing. They're like, this is like a three hour episode of founders. It's like the same person there, right? And I think that that is a thing that you did really well and we sort of accidentally did well, but I realized over time why that makes both of the things we've built as durable as they are. A lot of people play characters on the internet and. Which in other mediums plays really well. Is an easy trap to fall into. And it's a way to catapult growth. If you adopt a polarizing character, you can get a bunch of followers. There's a lot of dividends that pay to it, but it's exhausting to maintain over time and it has a conflict where when people meet you in real life, they're like, oh, weird. And so when you actually are just yourself, it's gonna probably grow more slowly because I'm not as polarizing. It would be horrifying to live as a polarizing character that you play on the internet in real life also. And so you have this more slow organic growth path. But there is this cool byproduct now where I sit down with someone and they're like, yep, exactly the same as I expected. This is why I said have Blake Robbins on here because he gave me the dynamic, that spectrum that he talks about. Blake is a super smart person in general, but he's like, the way you think about this is there's a spectrum. This is not my idea, this is Blake's spectrum. Because on one end of the spectrum, it's like how much time do people spend with you? He's like on one end of the spectrum, you have these 30 second TikTokers that dance. And then all the way on the other end of the spectrum, as you move down, they spend more time with you. All the way on the end of the spectrum, you have the Twitch streamers, which he helped incubate 100 Thieves, 40 Thieves, 100 Thieves, where they're spending 40 hours or 50 hours a week with you. He goes, David, you're like, one, you're not, they don't spend 40 hours with you, but you're one click to the left. And they're gonna wind up spending 10, 20, 100, 200 hours with you. And you keep moving down, and let's say you do 10 minute YouTube videos. It's like the deeper you go down there, it's why when I think of the guy's name is Nate Shot, when 100 Thieves has a new product and he announces it, you'll see a line down the block. Because hundreds of thousands of people have spent all their time with them. And so it's like, oh, Nate Shot has something to all come down here, and you see this over and over again. And then Blake says you could have like a TikTok, that has, TikTok has like 10 million followers, yet they can't even get 3000 people to show up somewhere. And so I think that is like the way to think about it. That's algorithmic throttling too. TikTok, it is almost a zero signal if somebody follows you. It's all views, doesn't matter. It doesn't actually matter. Or YouTube, it's like, oh, they subscribe to your channel? Maybe that'll come up in one of the top eight videos that shows up at the top of the screen of like what they should watch next, but like maybe not. So my point in all that is, if they're spending a lot of time with you, and I love, this is my flip of what Charlie Munger says, that you need to learn the big ideas in the main domains, like physics, psychology, because they carry the most freight. I flip that to time carries the most weight. As long as what we're doing, you said we're not playing characters, we are passionately interested in this, we're not gonna quit, then we do this over a long period of time. You'll get what you deserve. You'll get the audience you deserve, you'll get the business opportunities and everything else. It's like time carries the most weight. I know I'm not gonna quit. You're gonna have to pry the microphone from my cold dead hand, and I'm just gonna let the chips fall where they are. And that doesn't mean I'm like lollygagging here. Like I'm on it seven days a week. I'm gonna try to work myself in a position. So it's something I learned from Steve Jobs when he came back to Apple, right? And he's like, people hear that speech he gives, which he's fantastic. He's like wearing shorts, and he's like, I don't even know if he's in the turtleneck yet, but he mentions what they're gonna do. And everybody focused on the fact that he's like, there's no sex in the products anymore, and we're gonna do the four quadrant thing. A lot of people in the technology industry, particularly, know that speech, and they're like, yeah, let's cut the fat, and put all of our A players, fire the B and C players, put all of our A players in these four products that we're gonna make, right? Mobile or desktop, laptop, high-end. Yep, consumer and pro for both laptop and desktop. Those are the four categories, right? They missed what he said earlier when he talks about Nike. He's just like marketing. He's like, Apple sucks at marketing. We have to be a great marketing company. And so he said something where I read the quote in my reinterpretation of this, right? And people don't know that. It's in Ken's, no, it's in this book called Insanely Simple. I think that guy's name is Ken Siegel. And he's like, he was an ad guy at a company for Apple. And he's like. T-W-B-H-I-A-T day. It was the ad agency. So he goes, and every Wednesday, actions express priority. So there's another maxim, right? I don't care what people say. I care what they do. So when people ask me, first people that you talk to are the founders, like, hey, what would you do about this? I never answer as like, well, David Senor would do this. I'd say, hey, well, Charlie Munger would tell you this, or Steve Jobs would do this, or like, hey, I heard a story about here. Because my opinion is useless. You know my opinion on business building and how I build my business. It doesn't matter what I say. How is he approaching founders? Why is he making decisions? That's the important part, right? And so Steve told you that marketing was important to his actions because every Wednesday at like three o'clock, or I forgot the time. They had like a three hour meeting. He would approve, have to approve every single piece of advertising marketing that went out for Apple. There's not a billboard in Kentucky that went out without him saying, yes, it's gonna go out, right? And so in that speech, when you actually listen to what he's saying, he's like, listen, I feel that the products we're making in Apple make people's lives better. I want, he says this line, he goes, I want everybody in the world to own an Apple device. We know that it's not gonna happen because it's so expensive. But he goes, and to do that, we have to get really good at marketing. So my interpretation of that on the podcast, what I said is like, if you feel your product can improve people's lives, I think you guys already know, cause you get thousands of messages, just like I do, that yes, listening to Quire, listening to founders will improve people's lives and work, right? Then you have a moral obligation to get good at marketing. Well, all that means is not get good at marketing so our ad rates are gonna go up, or that we can be celebrities during that. It's no, so these messages for all these of history's greatest entrepreneurs that are dead, these ideas don't die with them. And then therefore, acquired founders can gather these ideas and push them down the generations. So that's why I mean, it's like, I'm not dilly dallying, I'm gonna let time carry all the weight, but I'm gonna do everything I can so more people at least know. And if you try founders say, oh, this sucks or whatever, whatever, I'm cool with that, but I just want you to have the opportunity to know it exists. And me and you have had these, us three have had these conversations where it's like, guys, I'm telling you right now, I've said this to you, there's millions of people that would benefit from listening to Quire, but they just don't know it exists yet. So we gotta come up and find ways to make sure that people know it exists, because they will love it, and it will make their lives better. Amen. I think there's also, this may be an area, I'm curious to see what you think about this, where our shows and approaches are a little different. I'm also curious what you've been thinking about this. A lot of these stories are just incredible stories too, that are just like, worth, I think worth telling just for the sake of the story. It's interesting how sometimes I'm like, I'm not sure that we came up with a lesson that I would advise a founder to follow, but I know this was very entertaining, and as true as we possibly can make it. And so, like I think- Every single episode I've listened to, there's lessons in there that I think- Oh yeah, I'm not saying there's not lessons, of course there are, but sometimes we'll do an episode, I always feel this way about the most recent episode, but we just finished making the Nintendo episode, I'm just like, you cannot, like if you put the best fiction writers in the world- That's true. To guess, and you said come up with the best corporate-ish story that you could imagine, you couldn't write something this good. I guess the thing I was referring to is a little bit the survivorship bias, where someone did something that I would not recommend anyone do, and it still worked. But it made for a great story, it's like Morris Chang in TSMC, he invented the notion of a fabless semiconductor company before there was any demand for that. And then it turned out that his timing was exactly right, that within a couple of years, a whole ton of fabless companies spun up and wanted to use his foundry, but he created a solution in search of a problem. And no founder should do that, but my God, did he pull a rabbit out of a hat. There's a good number of acquired episodes where I'm like, we should be crisper, I think about pointing out where, this was inadvisable, but amazing that it worked. I think that goes back to the game tape analysis where we talked about Kobe Bryant, Jordan did this too, where it's like, I read this 600-page biography of Kobe, and in the biography, they interview his high school girlfriend. And they're like, what was it like to date Kobe Bryant in high school? I'm surprised he had a girlfriend in high school. Well, not for very long. It's like, what was it like to date Kobe Bryant in high school? She's like, well, our dates consisted of me going to his house and watching tapes of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. That was his whole day. It's just like, we're not leaving, I'm not taking you out to dinner, we're literally gonna watch this thing. And so I think the game tape analysis of that is just like, it is helpful to realize that a lot of this stuff, it's impossible to plan in advance. It's the one of the great, I mean, Steve Jobs has a ton of great quotes. Oh, the Stanford speech. He's like, at the commencement, he's like, it's impossible. You're only gonna connect the dots looking backwards. So you have to put something, faith in something. You can call it karma, religion, God, intuition, but you have to do something. I just did a re-read Ray Kroc's autobiography, the guy from McDonald's. Again, and it hit me, yeah, I've been thinking about Steve Jobs' quote too. And this is why it's so valuable to re-read your past highlights. You mentioned this in the McDonald's episode. If you think about this, like he's a perfect illustration of what Steve observed 50 years after Ray dies, for God's sake. He's just like, he goes from selling paper cups. Paper cups leads him to selling multi-mixers, which are like, make milkshakes. Multi-mixers goes like, why the hell are you have eight, why does these McDonald's brothers out in San Bernardino have eight of my machines? People, he'd had a hard time selling one. That goes to the franchise system, which he didn't even do well. And then he meets Harry Sombor, and then Harry Sombor is like, dummy, you don't even know the business you're in. He's like, you don't build an empire off a 1.4% cut of a 15 cent hamburger. You build an empire by owning the land upon which that hamburger is cooked. Those five things. There's no, he's selling, he's spelt, he's selling. Paper cups to real estate. He sold paper cups for 17 years. But he just like, hey, I have to go in my gut to the point where he got divorced over this. His wife was like, you can't do this, Harry. And he's like, you have to trust my instincts. That's one thing, to what Ben said way back in the beginning of the conversation, that you're really good at highlighting Ray Kroc. Like, he was a terrible person. And he didn't try to hide it. Most people in autobiographies are trying to hide it. He's literally like, thank you very much, June Martino. My first employee for missing every single one of your kids' birthdays. You're gonna get some stock at McDonald's, it's gonna get you rich, but 20 years later, I'm gonna fire you. Yeah. And he didn't, you didn't have to put that story in there. He put the, he chose to put that, that's crazy, dude. I said on the podcast, I was like, listen, it's interesting, like I'm glad he persisted, interesting ideas for business, but like, not only do I never wanna do business with this guy, I wouldn't even wanna be his friend. Yeah. Like, I wouldn't wanna do business with Steve Jobs, but I wanna be his friend, you know? Oh yeah, he'd be a very interesting person to be friends with. Oh, I feel like the opposite. What's that? Like, I'd wanna do business with Steve, cause you could create incredible things together, but I'm not sure you'd wanna be friends. I think the difference is from like a founder's perspective, like, there is no working with Steve Jobs, it's working for. You hear the stories of how he even treated like his subcontractor, or not, like the owners of the companies that contract, it's like, these guys are empire builders. Like, they're literally building worlds. They're not used to being like, they're, Charlie was talking about this, cause you know, he loves like Lee Lu, the new guy, the BYD guy, Do Wan, I don't know his name, something. Yeah, yeah. Those guys, he loves Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore. Yep. And what you realize is like, it's like, these are founder types, but you can't be, like founders are benevolent dictators, or in some cases they're dictators of their own company, and like, some people call Lee Kuan Yew a dictator, it's like, oh, you can't do that in America, even if that would be beneficial. But all of them, there's no working with them. They're like, they're gonna be in complete control of the situation, like even being in the room with them. Like, I'm not saying they'd be rude or mean, but like, you're a subordinate to them, because everything is in, Ray Kroc, everything is, he says in the book, perfection is difficult, I'm demanding perfection in McDonald's, I will constantly keep expanding this empire until I die, if you get in my way, I will run you over. He's like, he says in the movie, he's like, if my competitor was drowning, I'd walk over and put a hose in his mouth. And he goes, and he was on the other end of the call, as McDonald's brothers, because they're fighting over this, and he goes, would you do the same? And the stated thing is, it's like, you're gonna have to compete on my level, or else I will literally destroy you. Yep. What, so, Warren and Charlie are so interesting, right? I'm trying to decide if they are the complete opposite of that, or if they actually are like that just in their own ways. Every single person has some kind of, like, their public persona is for that level, right? It's not like a podcast where they're gonna listen to Joe Rogan for 1,600 episodes, like, you know who Joe is, you can't ha, he's doing three hour shows, three days a week for 15 years, you have probably a good idea of who he is, you see flashes of like, you know, imperfection like we all have. I don't think you, you just, you don't get to that level without having, he's got sharp, they all got sharp elbows. Like, you ever heard Reed's stories about how Warren negotiates? It's like, 1250 bid. What about 14? 1250 bid. What about 13? 1250 bid. Well, it's because he's already, see, he spent 10 years analyzing your business, and he knows exactly the price that he's gonna buy it for, and so now he's telling you the price he's gonna buy it for. This wasn't like a new consideration that popped up, and he's like, oh, look at this, a business. It's like, no, at the scale he's operating at, he knows all the businesses, yeah. And this is from the Jim Clayton's autobiography where he buys Clayton Homes, and he even said, he wanted to sell it to Buffett, he idolized Buffett, and he talks about like, he wasn't insulting him by any means, but he's like, Warren wants the microphone, and if you're in an area where Warren doesn't want the microphone, he is not interested, and I've heard that about Warren a lot. You know, so it's like, they're world builders, like, he runs everything. You think you're gonna go from being poor to having $200 billion and not distort your perception of the world? Yeah. It's impossible. Say more about Warren wanting the microphone. What does that mean? Like, literally in person, like, they would do, I think they were doing, Jim Clayton was at either, like, an event to talk to the employees, or whatever the case was, he, like, Jim wanted to have input, and he's like, Warren would not allow it, like, he monopolized, and I've heard that about Warren, like, same thing, we're like, you're gonna. There's gotta be an element of him that, you know, loves the shareholder meetings. Oh. Of course. Like, he didn't need to do that. He didn't need to do that. He created an event around, you know, how he loves it. If he loves having a billion people come. Yeah, you know how he loves it, because he's still doing it. Right, right. Like, he doesn't have to do anything in the world that he doesn't want to do. And that's how you know he loves it. Like, they're beyond, I told you, we talked about earlier, how, like, just how disorienting it must be to, like, have, and I would love to know this feeling, don't get me wrong, like, have a $200 billion net worth, it's like, you're living life on, like, God mode. Like, it's insane. Like, I was watching this video, I don't know if it's true, but it's like, Jeff Bezos' private jet has its own private jet. Like, that's sick. His yacht has a chase yacht. Yeah, so like, your yacht has a yacht. I think it's like a guest yacht. Like, I think it's so that, I mean, he now owns the biggest yacht in the world, and there's a yacht that will sail behind it. I would say this maybe, I don't know, maybe will become so successful someday that I will regret my words on this, but I gotta imagine having a yacht is actually not, like, additive to your life. Oh, so this is a fun Ralph Lauren thing. I think that's more problems than. Yeah, so I think it was Ralph Lauren sold his yacht, and it's now a charter yacht, because he was like, this thing was more work than any of the businesses I've ever run. One of the most interesting ideas I've heard, and it comes from our mutual friend Jeremy, who I think we mentioned earlier in the podcast, hopefully we did, give him credit, I actually was talking to him and David Perreau, and I'm pretty sure Jeremy said this, not David, but he's like, I would actually make the argument, because everybody's like, oh, what does Charlie talk about, call the Berkshire jet the indefensible? The indefensible, yeah, right, right. And then wasn't there a second one, the indefensible two? The indefensible. Before they bought net jets, and now it's like, we should be on net jets. So you look at those, like, how could you possibly spend, you know, these yachts cost $25,000 an hour to operate in fuel, or some crazy number, that planes are the same, like, you know, how expensive they are, and Jeremy makes the point, and Jeremy knows, because he's been buying businesses forever, and he's exposed to, like, great wealth, people, you know, unbelievable amount of wealth, he goes, he makes the argument that they're actually underpriced assets. And I was like, ooh, tell me more, he's like. That's not what I would expect to hear. Yeah, I'm gonna tell you this book that just proved his point, I actually got a text him telling this. So he's like, they use it not for, you know, like, yachting, sitting there sunbathing, right? He's like, they're using it for, like, customers, and potential, and so I had heard this, and I'll tell you about how this relates to Invisible Billionaire, so I had heard this, because again, I've never raised money, I don't pay attention to the venture industry, I don't know anything about it, I just have a bunch of founder friends, and founders tell founders everything, and so I'll have these discussions where they're like, they describe the courting process that they get from some of these well-known, super famous people, and it's like, well, the process you just described to me sounds like the old rich dude that, like, wants to sleep with, like, a young woman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What would you do, right? And there's a, we actually didn't put it in the episode, there's a bunch of this in Nintendo history, because Warner Brothers bought Atari, and so Warner Brothers was running Atari as Nintendo was kind of like. And this is how they courted Nolan. That's how they courted, yeah, so that's how Warner Brothers courted Atari and Nolan, and then how they tried to court Nintendo was the private jets, the, what was it, it was Clint Eastwood. They put Clint Eastwood on the private jet with Atari, flying coast to coast. So what did I tell you? History doesn't repeat, human nature doesn't. These founder dudes are running technology companies now, and they're like, yeah, oh yeah, I'm not gonna name who. They're like, oh yeah, he gave us, he picked us up in Manhattan in his private helicopter, and we landed at his Hampton State. Do you think he got the deal? He got the deal. Yeah, yeah. This guy said, hey, come, what are you doing? It's Friday night, what are you doing Saturday morning? Okay, come on my private jet, I'm gonna take you to California with me. Yeah. Here, you wanna stay with your girlfriend at this mansion that I'm not using in, you know, X, Y, Z. So Jeremy was explaining to me. It's like the equivalent of like a luxury suite at a sports arena. Yep, same thing. It's for getting deals done. But they're operating at a different level where it's like, oh, these influence. And some founders, the smart ones, don't let, like Sam Walton, you know, he's like, don't give me a fricking gift. Right, right, right. That's why, like, everything in Bentonville is like, you can't come in here and woo me. Because they know it works. Yeah, right. If you give a Walmart salesperson like a bottle of gin or something, it's gonna influence him where he's just like, I want your price. You guys did a great job in your episodes. Like, tell me your lowest price, and then I'm gonna go to your, it better be your low price because I'm going to this guy, if you tell me a dollar, he sells me 98 cents. Don't waste my time. You're not gonna hear from me again. I have an obligation to the customer to do this, to find the lowest price for them. Yeah, because everything, his entire thing, the low cost structure thing, that's a Walton thing, that's a Sol Price thing, that's a Jeff Bezos thing, that's a Rockefeller thing. That's the most common theme in the history of entrepreneurship. Every single thing. Jeff is like, we're gonna have a lowest cost structure, we're gonna have a low cost structure, we're gonna be efficient, we're gonna be efficient. Somewhere along the line, 25 years later, now the technology startups is like, we can just spread money all the time because there's no interest rate. There's just money coming back. He built Amazon at a pretty different time than founders today. The business laws of physics were different when there were interest rates versus when there weren't. Well, he started when there were none. That's true. And then the environment changed as he was building it. But while it would have been stupid for Amazon to spend $100 million on something, on crazy marketing activities in 1997, you could imagine that in 2018, if all of your competitors had raised a billion dollars and were trying to chase market share as fast as possible, you either have to exit that market because you're gonna lose or play that game on the field. Even better, find a different way. Be more resourceful. But be more resourceful, it's easy to say, but when all your competitors are hiring all the best engineers by throwing a million dollars a year at them, you're just not gonna be able to build a good product if you don't try to play that game also. Yeah, for sure. But the whole thing, when Peter Thiel says this in his book, Paul Graham says it, it's just startups don't have the advantage, right? You're not gonna outspend Microsoft or Netflix. You gotta find underdeveloped talent. You gotta find these people that, if they were the credentialed or if they were the well-knowns, then they're gonna go take, you're gonna work for me $80,000 and some stock options or go make a million dollars a year at Netflix. That's the whole thing. You're not gonna win unless you are capable of finding underdeveloped talent. Silicon Valley used to be able to build high growth and profitable startups. The rule used to be you couldn't go public until you had over $100 million in revenue and you were profitable. If you didn't check both of those boxes, you weren't gonna IPO. And in 2021, of all the companies that went public, it had to be single digit percentage that were profitable. Were any of them? Yeah, I don't know. It's crazy. The game just changes. Well, to your point, if you have free money, the money supply, grass-like expanse, it's raining down, that's going to build. Did you listen to Doug Leone on, I know you guys had him on your show, but did you hear him on Invest Like the Best? Yeah, he was great. Like, he said he was telling crazy stories. I loved everything about that guy. I loved him when I heard him on your podcast too. It was like that tough love. This is what I'm into, right? He still has, I think maybe my favorite quote, favorite quote said live on an acquired podcast of you could burn cigarettes in our arms and we wouldn't flinch. And then he has a great line. He's like, I want you to know we were killers. We weren't killers to make the most money. We were killers to get the job done. But he made the point, and very few people probably know more about the venture industry than that guy, right? I would imagine he's up there. And he's like, of course. Like, you have money raining down, you didn't use that word. It just creates bad habits. Yeah. It is crazy how many things in my life I falsely attributed to something that were not just interest rates. Like, so many things. The answer is just like, oh, it is that way because we live in a zero interest rate environment. And the human brain likes to tell stories. And at the end of the day, it's like, things are the way they are because of mean reversion and what the current interest rate climate is. I wish, I'm gonna pull up something. Like, this is what I mean. Goes back to Buffett. Like, if you just, we should have, I wish I knew this. I had read this, I didn't remember it though. This is Warren Buffett on interest rates, right? He says- Oh, is this from- Laws of Gravity? The log in Snowball? No, this is from his shareholder letters. He said it 84, 88, something like this. I think the intro to Snowball, I think the scene that opened, the vignette that opens it is Sun Valley right before the bubble bird, the tech bubble burst. Oh no, this is like decade and a half before. Oh, okay, okay. This is why it's like, so it's like, God, like you could have made such better decisions, I could have made such better decisions if you had just known this and he had known it for 40 years before it happened. I posted this on Twitter and I opened up the next day, I'm like, why does this have two and a half million views? It's like, Elon replied, he goes, yep. I was like, oh, okay. I was like, what the, like what the, damn, you people really like interest rates. It's all grand replies on steroids. So I go, Warren Buffett on interest rates and the headline is, they power everything in the economic universe. So that was what Elon was responding up to and this is Warren writing in the 80s, the value of every, exactly what you're saying, the value of every business, the value of a farm, an apartment house or any other economic asset is 100% sensitive to interest rates. That's because all you're doing when you're investing is transferring money to someone now in exchange for a stream of money which you expect to come back in the future and the higher the interest rates are, the less that present value will be. This is fantastic. Interest rates are to asset prices sort of like gravity is to an apple. When interest rates are low, there is little gravitational pull on asset prices. We just lived through this, right? When interest, textbook. Yeah, when interest rates are low, there is little gravitational pull on asset prices. Interest rates power everything in the economic universe because I found that because all this, remember the inflation went crazy like a year or two ago or whatever. And I was like, okay, every time that happens, all I do is I have, you can buy the Kindle version of Buffett shareholder letters for like two bucks. I know, it's crazy. And I search it for like interest rates, inflation. And I just go and I read, okay, this is what- You made a billion dollars off that $2 purchase. There you go. And so like you'll say, okay, this is what he said inflation and then you see what year he said it. And it's just like, and that's where I found that. I go, what did he say about interest rates? Boom, 1980 whatever. And he just laid out exactly- It's so funny, because what he also did right there is for every college finance sophomore that's having to go through a class to do DCFs and they're like, I don't understand this. This is complicated. Like he just explained conceptually a discounted cashflow model there in a way that was like unbelievably digestible. He's so good at that. The clarity of thought. Because he wants the microphone. Look, now, but also like he just educated you in a way that makes more sense and is interesting and you're entertained by. And you might build a business off that and then you might wanna sell one day or whatever the case is. It's like, this is where I'm spending a lot more time of like really trying to work on storytelling ability and concision, right? Yeah. The value is in the compression and the distillation, right? If you could listen to like an audio book for 25 hours, but if I can give you the best idea or one idea that changes your life and I can do it every week or whatever, like in a couple of minutes, like that is going, some of that value is gonna be brought back to me. And all that comes from is, what I realize is all my heroes have like, what they have in common is like the unbelievable clarity of thought. Like Steve Jobs, Charlie, like you're not gonna be like, oh, what does that mean? They take unbelievably complex things. Like you're not advertising to a standing army, you're advertising to a moving parade, make it in a memorable way and then you carry that maxim with you forever. How do you get better at that? You said you're working on it. Reps, just straight up reps. Like thinking about it and then hearing yourself back. The advantage I have that I edit is, you can say something and like, oh, that was so good and then you hear it back and sometimes it's even better or many times it's worse. It's like, oh, I lost it. I know what I'm saying, but you missed this part that doesn't make any sense. And so normally I have to cut it. I don't think I've ever re-recorded something. We only did that for one episode ever. It's really hard to do. What, re-record? Yeah, do you know which episode we did it for? No. It was recent. NFL. David and I got on and re-recorded 40 minutes of material over maybe 15 different parts of the episode. The original recording of that episode was really rough. The NFL episode was too long when we started. It took way too long to get to the interesting part, the Pete Rozell era. And so we had this like massively bloated beginning and then we had a story arc that didn't cleanly resolve and we had a bunch of concepts where we didn't nail the explanation. And so we went in, we cut like half of the first epoch of the story. We recorded new bits to like create nice rising action and resolution on the Rozell era. And then we recorded another like 10 areas where we were just like, this wasn't said super tight. And I'm really curious if people noticed because we had to like, we basically had a voice act. Like we'd listen to the way that we sort of came into that segment, get that in our heads. This was your theater background coming in. And then like pick it up from there. But yeah. Your editing is so good. We've talked about like back catalog sponsorship and you told me what you're doing was like Zoom info. And I've been listening to your back catalog and it's like, dude, it sounds like it was there the day you did it. It is perfect. And I know because we talk about this that that ad was not there, but it sounds like it's there. That's the goal. The NFL episode is what I meant. I've been like, it's a crazy story, but even there is like a lesson where like you guys, I texted you, you like totally changed the way I think about things. Or maybe we were talking on Zoom about this. I never thought of that. The NFL is like the largest media company. Yeah, yeah. I hadn't either. And the funny thing is that was a David Rosenthal insight that like the NFL is the single largest media property by value. And the funny thing is if you go look at the, because we did this for the Nintendo episode, you go look at the largest media properties. They list Mario, they list Pokemon. And I think if you sort the list includes like video games and movies and so there's like the MCU in there and there's Star Wars in there. But like they don't think, the NFL is way bigger than all of those, but it's not on the list because people don't think of it as like a media property. I love looking for stuff like that, both to do episodes on and as for investing too. It's like, what is something that is just so like in the air that people don't even realize what it is? Or what's a comparison we can make that is super eye opening but people haven't thought to compare those two things before. Yep. Which is why I tie things in to past, because it's like, oh this. Episode 244. The idea, no but the idea behind this is like we've seen this before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I reread like the show notes on like the Johnny Ive episode I did. Johnny said something was great and he said, he goes one of Steve's talents was identifying markets full of second rate products. Mm, yeah. And so like he would be like, oh there's the opportunity here and we're both, we're all podcast addicts, right? And the reason that we get along is because. And it's a market full of second rate products. Because you know how hard it is to do. Yeah. And when you go and listen to other business podcasts and like I had a friend, his friend has a podcast and he's like, hey these three guys, they have large social media followings but it does not translate to episodes. People don't understand. Yeah, rarely will. Yeah, and they're like, would you listen to their episode and give it feedback, right? And we went to like, so I was like, yeah listen to it and I go, it's three guys sitting around talking whatever happens to pop into their mind. What did you expect to happen? Which is kind of what's happening here. I was thinking the same thing. I was like, we did some self-over. We apologize on this episode, Max Craft. There's zero chance that people aren't, do people interested in entrepreneurship and investing are not finding this interesting? Because the prep for this is not three guys that have a million other things to do. It's three guys that do this all the time. All the time. Over and over again, that's gonna cop up naturally in a conversation that you can, but oh, I didn't know about this. Maybe there's a bunch of people probably like, I didn't know who Evan Land was. I didn't know Ogilvy. I never thought about the NFL as a large media company. So no, but their problem thing is like, there's no value proposition. This is actually something that I think ties into much of what we've talked about over the last couple hours. People are gonna do what they want to do. And if people can do what they wanna do and are given unfettered freedom to run in it, they can do great things. If people are forced to do things that they don't wanna do, they're not gonna make great things. Or either forced to or choose, put themselves in a situation for whatever reason where they're doing something they don't want to be doing, they're not gonna be very good at it. I think that's one of the reasons why we find ourselves so attracted to episodes that highlight craft is because that's sort of like how we think about acquired. Like if LVMH benchmark, it's like people who do few things but do them exceptionally well are just so entrancing to study. I think this goes back to what you were just saying, and I wanna go to the craft thing. It's like Charlie again, has these simple ideas. Most of the problems are that you're just not intensely interested in what you're working on. And he's like, I don't care how smart you are. And Charlie's smarter than almost everybody else. He goes, I was not successful until I moved myself into a position where I worked on something I was intentionally interested in. That just these small rules carry most of the weight. It's like, how bad do you actually want it? And if you're not willing to do those things, then there's nothing wrong with that. Entrepreneurship is for a very small percentage. I'm not one of these people to think everybody can be an entrepreneur. I would like to see more of them. But there's no safety net. It's like no one's telling you what to do. No one had to tell you guys, hey, you should buy microphones and do a bunch of research and pick a name. But we didn't buy microphones to start. Oh yeah, but like. Yeah, I think the most interesting thing is that like, I think we've talked about this concept before on air is that if someone's gonna advise you on starting a podcast, they would say, do a 30 to 40 minute episode and like do it weekly. So there's, and you release it at the same time all the time. Have a guess so that way that person promotes it too. And we're like, okay, well we do the opposite of all of those things. And I think it's like, the conclusion I've come to is advice is an average and reality is a distribution. And averages suck because they hide the distribution. You kind of wanna know the shape of the distribution and you kind of wanna know like things that apply to your specific data point, not like the average thing. And I think like advice is always an average that hides the distribution. And if you know that you're actually an outlier in some way, then you have to sort of like selectively follow advice because it may not apply to you. Charlie told me a fantastic story about this where he's just like, he was singing the praises of BYD that they're kicking ass. He told me, not just me, I'm always a group of people. They make batteries for cars. And they make cars. Yeah, but he started out like doing knockoff cell phones in Korea or something. And then like, I forgot the guy's founder's name and I apologize, but he was telling me the life story. But he was saying that the founder, that Charlie and Li Lu, Li Lu, Li Lu, gave the founder advice and he ignored it and he was right. He's like, don't go into electric cars or whatever it was that he did. And he was selling, I think he said like two billion cars. I forgot what, two million cars. There's no way he sold two billion cars in a year. So he sold like two million cars in China. China is a big market. Yeah, so he was just like, and he did it and he gets all the credit because Li and me told him not to do it. And he's just like, same to your point. It's game tape. It's just like when Kobe is watching this particular play of Michael Jordan, that may never appear in his life. And maybe the move he did wasn't the right move for what Kobe did, but maybe it influences his other thing. It's just like, the life is complex and messy. And you can think you're really smart and until you have a two and a half year old and they ask you, why is that the way? And you answer the question. And then their follow-up question is going to be why. And eventually you're gonna get to 11 where like, I don't know. Like, I don't know why. Everything ends at I don't know. It's like, I don't know. And so, of course there's no certainty. That's why if you crave certainty, you've gotta get a job. There wasn't even Facebook when I was in college because I had to work full time and went at night. But my college did not have Facebook. It was just coming out. So we had MySpace. And MySpace, you could put a quote, right? Like at the header. And I've always thought like this for my entire life. It was like, there's no security in life, only opportunity. And I think that's what we did. So investors and entrepreneurs are going for opportunity at the expense of security. And if you need security, you can get a job, but we see like, everybody said, go into tech, go into tech, go into tech. Look, you make all this money. I think this is a super mispriced thing. I think people who crave security, which I get, like all humans crave some level of security, sort of mispriced security because no jobs are as secure as we think they are, but they definitely cap your upside. And people, it's like, is founding a company or going into business for yourself as an entrepreneur extremely risky? Yes, it is. But is it actually that much riskier than a job where you could get laid off or the sector could go through a downfall or like, there are a lot of things about having a job that are not nearly as secure as people think they are. Steve Wozniak in jobs, they're like, worst case scenario, if this doesn't work, what does it go get jobs? We're broke anyways. Right. Let's just try. And he like sells his van for like 50, Steve sells his van for like $1,500. Like, oh, I'm just all in on Apple. Like, that's, to me, that's like, again, I think a lot of this is like people are asking, it's like it's entrepreneurship, like innate, can it be taught? Can there be a school of entrepreneurship? And I was like, well, ask Charlie Munger if he taught a business class, what did he say? He's like, I would just teach the history of, what do you guys do? He's like, I teach you the history of 100 companies and I would talk about what went right and what went wrong. There's no security, there's no, he's not saying, yeah, take my class. And on the other end, you get this degree that guarantees business success that doesn't exist. Well, that's what's cool. Like, they have been teaching entrepreneurship for the last 50 years. So I was in, so I went to UCF, which is this like diploma mill, essentially, and I was in the pilot entrepreneurship program, right? The very first year. And it's a two-year program. Wait, so do you, take us back to that. Yeah. Were you thinking about, what was your relationship to entrepreneurship before starting the Founders Podcast? So like, I have never been on a job review. I've only had two jobs in my life. Like, I was, but I was like, there was no entrepreneurship. There was no entrepreneurship like community. There was no entrepreneurship industry, right? So like my first business was, this is a long story, but like, I had been accustomed, I was talking about this yesterday. By the time I was 17, I had been accustomed to working full-time and going to school, right? So like, people were like, oh, you work a lot on founders. It's like, I don't have to go to school. I can like do this all the time. You work in half-time, as far as you're concerned. Yeah, so it's like, there's a long story here, like, that would take me like 30 minutes, but like, like my dad sat me down when I was like 15. He's like, listen, you don't have to pay rent, but like, I don't have any money for you. So like, if you want something, you gotta go get it, right? And the good thing about my dad, he's a Cuban immigrant, not educated, but like, the best piece of advice that he ever gave me and my brother was a maxim. He's like, don't half-ass things, right? So he does it in like a blue collar. He's a truck driver, like, you know, that kind of thing where he's like, he prides himself on the fact that like, he'll work 72 hours straight, right? But he never made a lot of money and never had an education, like his mom wasn't good, whatever, and they had to escape Castro's Cuba. My dad was born in Cuba. So it's like, imagine like, I talked about this on, cause you know Patrick's at the end of every episode he says, he's like, what's the nicest thing ever did to you, or for you did to you, for you. And I was like, man, like something that, it was a decision that happened way before I was born. And like my grandfather is in Cuba in 1959, 1958. And he, again, not an educated man. He worked as a butcher and worked in a factory that made shoes. He's married and he's got a baby. That baby is my dad. And Castro comes to power. And he doesn't have a lot of money, doesn't speak English. And yet he had some kind of insight that I need to get out of here, right? And he goes to a country, picks up, loses everything, not that you had a lot anyways, goes to country, knows nobody, doesn't speak English. Goes to country, knows nobody, doesn't speak the language. When I sat down, the first thing me and Sam Zell talked about, and I think helped bond us, that's to the point where at the end he said he liked my energy and everything, but so hopefully he liked me, I don't know, was in his story, I was like, cause I had obviously read his autobiography. And one of the first things me and Sam talked about was, Sam, I understand and empathize with your story because Sam's story is his dad being Jewish, getting the last train out of Poland before the Nazis bomb it. Literally the last train out. 18 members of his family, his dad went around to saying, we gotta get out of here, this is not good. They're like, no, we're gonna stay. They're all dead. Sam, Sam's dad and his mom have a daughter. They get to America. His mom's pregnant. Sam is born in America. And so in that book, Sam's dad's always telling him, you don't understand how lucky you are to be born here. And I was like, I understand that mentality because I grew up meeting, Cubans have this thing called nocho wena, which is they don't celebrate, my wife's Colombian, so I married into a Colombian family, they do this too. They don't celebrate Christmas on Christmas day. They do it the night before. It's a Christmas Eve. And so I grew up, for as long as I can remember, I was like eight, seven, 10, 10 years old, meeting people that came over on rafts. And you would see these things. I've seen these in person. It's just like, think about how bad it has to be. It's like 50 miles, right? 90 miles, right? I'm gonna go over it to the study the University of Miami just did on this. 90 miles, you're a parent. Hopefully you might be a parent one day. You love your kids way more than you love yourself. There's people that came, hundreds of thousands of people went to the edge of the island and put their kids on a raft, just in hopes that they get to America. And so the problem is, you don't make the announcement to everybody, it's like, hey, tomorrow we're leaving on a raft, could you get caught? You know, imprisoned or killed or whatever the case is. And so the University of Miami did this study, it was like, well, how many people did this? We know hundreds of thousands survived. And they estimated at least, I think, something like half a million people perished, never got there. There's a conversation with, there's this UFC fighter named Jorge Masvidal, who was in Miami, he's a Cuban guy, and his dad was one of the ones that escaped, he went on a, their raft was made out of a truck tire, like, you know, think of like a, size of like a bulldozer tire, right? Wow. It's his uncle and two 14-year-old boys. They get off path, right? They run out, their water wound up being contaminated, so you can't drink, you'll die. How do they propel it anyway? Like, how do you make sure it gets to Florida? You have like, some have oars and some have like, see that blanket over there? Like, you try to make a, A sail. A sail out of like a blanket or, you know, some of these are unbelievably in, like, they're a lot of ingenuities, like, for uneducated, they don't have the internet, like, it's unbelievable. And so, in his case, I know they had oars, I think they had a sail. They get close enough to the Bahamas, they haven't drank water for like, three or four days or something, a pigeon lands on the oar. They wind up killing the pigeon, opening it apart and drinking the blood. That's the only thing that's saved. And so now his, so he gets to America, eventually gets to go from the Bahamas to America. Now his son is like, you know, makes millions and millions of dollars, like, as a professional fighter and a celebrity and all this other stuff. So anyways, long story short, the one thing like, my dad's still alive, I told you, my mom passed away. But like, I really think like, my dad, for just, like, he did not baby me at all, he's just like, you gotta like, figure out how to get a job. And so I worked at, back then, this is something that Paul Graham made the point of, right? He's like, dude, when I was a kid, the only jobs available were, you gotta scoop ice cream or something. And like, you've probably met them. I met some 17 year old founders, a bunch of founders. You talk to them, they're on their second company. I'm like, what? They're like, oh yeah, when I was like, ninth grade, I did this like, Gmail plugin or like, I was like, I made 40,000. I had this staff tool. Yeah, I made $40,000 a month. And like, I'm taking so much money, my parents let me drop out of high school so I can do this business. I'm like, I worked at a car wash, dude. I made $4.65 an hour, you know? So anyways, long story short, I would go to school year round, right? Cause I had figured this out, where it's like, oh, if you, most people went to summer school, they were forced to, I went to public school in my whole life, right? And so like, people would go to public school, they would be forced to, cause you failed something else. But if you elected to do that, in six weeks, you get a full semester's credit and there's two six week terms. Yeah, like mini-mesters. So I always, even when I was in college, I did this. I would go to school year round, right? And so in high school, I went to school so much that by the time I got to my last two years of high school, I was in this program called OJT, which is on the job training. So instead of having six periods, you leave after the fourth period and you'd have to have a job and you would get two, your other credits through your employer. So your employer would have to like, fill out paperwork. Like is David cleaning cars? And like, oh, there's a baby that came in and threw up. He did a good job with that, it was disgusting. But the benefit of that was being able to work full time, make enough money where I could like buy, I bought like a new car with my own money, like all that other stuff. And so like, then I realized like, oh, I think I was making like 400 or $500 a week in high school, which is freaking really good. This is like late 90s, early 2000s. And then I got promoted to being a detailer. You have client list. And then you start to found relationships. It's like every other business. And they're like, hey, I love what you do. Would you do this at my house? Or would you do it on my boat that you don't do? Or like whatever. And so my first business was just detailing cars and boats and taking out all this other stuff where it's like, okay, I spent an hour waxing this guy's car. I might make 20 bucks. I do it at his house, I make $150. And so like, I've always just had that like, and again, there's not like, this is a story you guys read in the books and the stories. It's like, there's no master plan here. It's like, hey, I need to make money. All of my other friends were working at McDonald's, Chick-fil-A, where you just said something like they cap. I never had a capped upside. And then so I did all these other businesses. I started in college because I thought I was gonna be a lawyer. And this is so silly because everybody, all my friends are lawyers, hate it. I dodged a bullet there. That's the dream, the immigrant dream is for the kids to become lawyers and doctors. Right? Not with my parents. So my parents never said the word college to me once. Not one time, because they're both high school dropouts. So like, they never, I was one of the only kids in high school to never have a curfew. Like my parents knew I was independent and left me. That's the best thing they get. It's like, oh, David can take care of himself. They thought, my mom told me, she's like, I just thought you were a lot smarter than everybody else in our family. So like. We trusted you to make the right decision. Well I was also driven too, but she, because you have to understand, being smart in this family is not like being, the bar is low in the sense that like, they're both coming from multiple generations of people that did not prioritize education or self-improvement. So that's why I'm so ferocious in this because I didn't see that. And so this demonstrated when my mom was dying of cancer. So like, you know, HIPAA has this thing where like they're not gonna share paperwork or information unless like it gets permission from the person. And like, my mom could choose whoever she wanted to. She could have chose her husband, right? They had a bad relationship. They should have got, they got divorced and remarried. They should have stayed divorced, but whatever. And she, you see that with actions. We said that actions discuss priorities. She's like, we're in there. And she's like, who do you want the paperwork? Or who do you want us to communicate? She's like, David, not her other kids, not her husband, not her sister. She trusted me implicitly. And so I essentially like, they never met in college. So I just kept this routine. I was like, people are like, oh. They're like, what do you wanna do for a living? And like, I remember watching TV when I was younger. I was like, well, I wanna be rich. And you think when you're younger, you know anything. Like, who's rich on TV? Like, I liked Fresh Fritz of Bel Air. I was like, I could be a judge or a doctor. And I was like, oh, I can't see blood. Like that freaks me out. So now I could be an attorney. So I went to school and I worked full time. And I was trying to hustle anything I could do. And so the idea was like, okay, I'm just gonna go undergrad for business because I'm interested in business anyways. But I'm only doing that till I go to law school, right? And the point of this story was not to go on this deviation, but I was in the entrepreneurship program, the pilot one, right, because I was already interested in trying to make money in any way possible. And this is how bad the entrepreneurship was. And this is why I'm kind of jealous of these young kids where now you actually have an entrepreneurship industry and there's stuff you can learn from. The head, the main, what is it called? Like the main subject, Entrepreneurship 101, right? The curriculum. Yeah, but there's all these other classes, but Entrepreneurship 101 is run the teacher, right? What is her credentials? Her dad started an AC company in Florida. You're gonna make a lot of money. Yeah, that's a good one. And he died on the job because he got electrocuted to death. Oh God. She inherited the company and then she ran it and so she's the teacher. And so the curriculum was terrible. It was terrible. The best thing, and this relates to what we do for a living now, which I could have never predicted, is there was a guy that, this is kind of like Charlie Munger says you should read if you want to learn about incentives in a really difficult business, read Les Schwab's autobiography, which I did because Charlie told me to. He did it like a long time ago. And he's like, this guy made a ton of money in a really hard business, which is like tires and like oil changes and stuff like that. And so the guy was coming into the class. He was gonna donate like three or $5 million to have a building named after him. And he had one prerequisite. He goes, I wanna talk to your entrepreneurship students before I give you this money. And I learned more in one hour from that dude than I did in two years in entrepreneurship because he would talk for like 20 minutes and then he's like, open up your questions. And I lit him up with question after question. After question. And I remember to this day, just like the simple way, he was building his business in probably the 80s and 90s. And he's like, how did you know where to expand? And he's like, we would pull the car registration data from the DMVs, right? And we would know how many car owners there were in this specific radius. And we'd have to hit, like let's say we need 40,000 car owners in a three mile radius. Are there any other stores? Put a store right there. And they did that over and over and over and over again. Yeah, and so like he had ideas like that. And just like, again, you learn through experience. Like that guy could teach us way more because he actually did this compared to. I think probably all three of us have a like unintended impact of college entrepreneurship programs on us. You definitely do. I have a minor in entrepreneurship. Yeah. Really? Yeah, from Ohio State. Similarly, only ever went to public school. Yeah. I was a little different. Like I was really into computers. When I was 10, my dad and I found a PC on the side of the road. And he was like, do you want to install Linux? And I was like, what's Linux? And like he taught me to use a terminal. Like I was really lucky to have a dad as an engineer. And so I went to college for computer science. But. Wait, wait, wait. Back up. You found a PC on the side of the road. 100%. And you were like, let's install Linux. And my dad's like, I'm willing to bet that thing is just old. He's like, because we're looking at the, you know, at that point you could open computers. So we're like looking at it. He kind of like, tooks it apart. It looks inside. He's like, he's got all the pieces. Like this is just an old computer that someone's throwing away. That's amazing. All right, keep going. So you majored in computer science? Yeah. But I like went in thinking like, I want to have some kind of like, I want to do business and tech, but I didn't know what that meant. And so I found my way to a club called the Business Builders Club. And they were like, oh, there's like a real, like an actual minor that you can take. And so sort of like through student organizations found my way to actually doing something in the College of Business, which like, I go back and forth on whether undergraduate business stuff is useful. Cause on the one hand, But you're not worried, all your buddies, you guys have all done amazing things. We just came back from my bachelor party and half the crew is the Business Builders Club, Ohio State friends that I made there. The content sucks, but the relationships are everything. But the relationship, that's what, yeah. And it's not, the stuff you're learning is actually super important, but you don't have the context for why yet. It's like, you're working on a DCF model and you're like, I don't, this is useless to me. Or you're like learning about depreciation and amortization. You're like, this is awful. Cause I have nothing. Whereas my physics classes were awesome. Like there's labs, like I can touch and feel the things and understand mechanical advantage and how the free body diagram works. But in these business concepts are like super abstract. And they weren't useful to me then, but I went and took a Coursera class last year, two years ago on accounting. Cause I was just like, okay, I wanna actually understand accounting. In part cause we talk about it on Acquired all the time and David understands this stuff more than I do and I feed it. But it is so much more useful when you understand where the rubber meets the road in the real world. Like it would just be beneficial just to go out and try to sell something. Like in class, like get real world experience. Like what did Charlie, I just reread, you guys read the Tao of Charlie Munger? No. I've heard it's good. Okay. I can't remember if I looked at it for the episode or not. I own the hardcover, the Kindle and the audio book. That should tell you like it's worth it. By the way, I own the audio book and the Kindle of almost every book that I own. Including the hardcover too? No, I don't own that many. You're not a hardcover person. Cause you can also switch. That's the whisper sync or whatever it's called. And all the time, I actually hate that they sync cause my common workflow in doing acquired research is I listen to the book and then I'll take some notes and Apple notes of like half quotes where I'm like, I gotta look this up later. And then I go back in the Kindle and I search for the actual quote and like pull out the data to be able to use it in the episodes. I think listening to the audio book before reading the book is very helpful. It gives you a basic overview. It's almost like reading a Wikipedia page before you read the biography. It's not enough detail, but like you have, okay. Like watching a movie for the second or third time, you know how it ends and it gives you, you pick up on things you missed the first time. In the tale of Charlie Munger though, Charlie was talking about this where he's just like, I learned about business at the Buffett grocery store, right from the cash register. It's like, cause that money is the lifeblood of all, I think the quote in the book is like, money is the lifeblood of all businesses. And that's where the cash would, that's where the money was at this point. And it's like, you just learn. And he says like, you learn the importance of like showing up on time, how to work with people you don't like, like how to service, like take care of your customers. Like these are things that are all like universally applicable that there, it's another form of education. Like that's the biggest, the key of experience and why it's so important. It's the most valuable form of education cause it's education of life. Like I love to read like more than almost anybody else. Like you guys obviously love to read. There's just so much things you can't learn from books. So it's just like, it's not enough. David, what was your college entrepreneurship? Well, it's funny. It's more thematic than an actual impact, but I can't remember if I've talked about this before. Princeton had then just one entrepreneurship class. It was like one class in the department of electrical engineering. I was not an electrical engineer, but people knew about this cause like, oh, this is cool. And I, so senior year, I had already, the recruiting happened in the fall. So I was already like had my job, investment banking job that I was gonna go do. Yep. A whole nother can of worms, but I was like, oh, you know, I'll take this class. It's supposed to be good. I'm gonna go work on Wall Street. I should learn about high tech entrepreneurship was the name of the class. And it was like all, you know, guest lecture. It was case method. And Ed Schow, the professor would have guests come in. One of the guests, either the last or like the second to last class was Tim Ferriss. What? Right before he published the four hour work week. No way. Yes. He asked Buffett a question. At the end of the meeting. I'm a guest lecturer at Princeton. You're in the class. Oh, he totally hustled this. He like traded on that name for like years before he made it as Tim Ferriss. Cause he just went in for one class. It was one class. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was one day of one course. And that was like this case study class. And I think he had taken the class when he was at Princeton and Ed, the professor liked him and kind of took a shine to him. So you and I are then our guest lecturers at Columbia. Oh yeah, totally. Yeah, oh yeah. We're guest lecturers everywhere. So he came in and so he was working on the book, but it was like done, but like was about to get published. And so he came in and the whole class was like basically telling his story and then like showing the book. I remember in my notes, like for the class, I titled them, I have them still somewhere on my, on an old computer. The title was supplement guy. Do what you love. That is the moral of the story. Oh my God. And then, oh man, afterwards, talking about missed opportunities. He was like, he's older than me, but he's not that much older. He had only been out for a couple years. So class ends and he was like, hey guys, anybody want to hang out? Like, I'm gonna go, you know, I'm gonna go like hang at Terrace. Like if you want to come at, Princeton has eating clubs instead of, they do have fraternities, but like, one of them is Terrace and Jenny was actually in Terrace. And it was like, basically I'm gonna go like hang out and have a good time with anybody who wants to come along. And I was like, nah. Now I'll see you on the podcast circuit later. I love how this just was uncovered in random conversation, right? It was just like computer science, investment banking, law. No, but like. No common denominator. No, and like, and look where. I use theater more than I use computer science. Like that was what, yeah. Like the idea of like, from venture capitalists and podcasters, right? I went and my daughter asked me to go speak at Career Day. Oh, hell yeah. And this was last year, so she would have been. That's like the greatest thing. She went into fourth grade, right? I can't wait. And so she's like, well daddy, like you have a weird job. Like will you come in. You have a weird job. Yeah, she's like, will you come in and like give a talk. And so you mentioned earlier, like entrepreneurs are like odd ducks and like crazy people. They don't like, they don't like, they see rules. It's like, oh, that's just words written down on paper. Like I'll just do my own thing. So I show up and I say, yeah, I'll do anything for you. Like whatever you want. And so I show up and there's two, each class at the school she has has two teachers, right? And so they're like, oh, well we didn't, hi Mr. Senator, we didn't get your email. Did you get like, did you bring like a thumb drive? I'm like, what was I supposed to email and why would I have a thumb drive? And they're like, you're a PowerPoint presentation. And I go. Have you ever made a PowerPoint presentation in your life? Never. And I go, no, but this is right. I go, they're nine. Why would I make a PowerPoint presentation? Yeah. And so I go there and I was like, I was like, listen, I'm fine. Like I'll wing, like I got this. Like they're like, you're gonna wing it. They didn't use the word wing it, but I forgot what it was. You're like, no, really, I got this. I show up, right? And they're all like sitting on the floor and there's like 39 year olds. Are you like, stand up? No, no, no, no, never. And so. I wanna see some energy. And I was like, I talk for two minutes, right? I have 30 minute slot. I go, I talk for two minutes. I was like, listen, don't listen to your parents. Don't listen to your teachers. I go, follow whatever you're intensely. I just gave Charlie Munger's advice. I go, what are you interested in? Keep following that even if it doesn't, there's not an obvious career path. And I use the word, I go, it's highly likely that the job that you're gonna have has not yet been invented. I was like, there was no such thing as a podcaster. Like I couldn't go to school for podcast engineers. Or whatever. And like, so that was like the two minute summary. And I said a little bit more than that. I go, okay, now what questions do you have for me? And so I spent the next 28 minutes. I told them the importance of reading. I was like, listen, your friends are all gonna be in these stupid apps. I was like, you're gonna have no attention span. Learn how to read and read whatever you're interested in. Your daughter's probably like, oh my God. So I'll tell you the funny thing. So then 28 minutes and then they're telling me about books they love. They're like, oh, I like Harry Potter and I like this and I like travel and we had like the greatest time, right? So I come back, there's like nine in the morning I leave. And my daughter gets out later on in the day and she goes, Daddy, thank you very much. My friends thought your talk was the best. I was like, oh, that's like interesting. I'm glad they liked it. I go, well, let me ask you a question. Who came after me? And they're like, oh, it was John's mom or something. I was like, oh, what does John's mom do? She's like, I go, well, first of all, did she do a PowerPoint? She goes, yes, everybody did a PowerPoint. And I go, what does John's mom do? She goes, oh, she's a corporate attorney. I'm like, so you, like they're nine years old. And also that's like the alternate future for you. Like it was like, you would have had a PowerPoint. It was like bizarro David going after you. It'd be interesting like what you would, yeah, but then again, I was living in Florida and like the law there is not a lot, like you'd have to move to like DC. Like the law there is like insurance. So I'm at the San Francisco airport, right? Which is way nicer than Miami International Airport, by the way. It's like, I've never been to Miami International Airport. Oh, it's like third world, man. It's just like the ceilings are low. They have the new, they built like this new part, but SFO was way nicer than mine. And I see this billboard of, it says the world's, or the America's largest personal injury attorney. That guy was in Orlando. I was going to go in Orlando at the time. His name's John Morgan. He was famous back then and now he has. So like that, I've probably worked for him. Like I'm like chasing ambulances or whatever. No disrespect, like whatever you gotta do to pay your bills. Like I have no problem with that. But yeah, I just thought it was funny. I was like, you also have to think independently. They're nine years old. Like they don't wanna sit through, I don't even wanna sit through a PowerPoint. It's certainly not like when I'm nine. Nobody wants to sit through a PowerPoint. No, I would've just brought a video game console or something. I was like, that's my video game console. Maybe you could decide. That's a viable career. Blake and Mitch, Blake Robbins and Mitch Lasky made the point in one of their GameCraft episodes that I never even thought of. They're like, you know how hard it is how few pure software companies are that sell over a billion dollars a year in software and how many game companies, they said on the podcast, like there's so many video game companies that make so much money. I think they say the video game industry's bigger than music, movies and books combined or whatever. And it has been since the 90s. Yeah, that was the interesting thing we uncovered on the Nintendo episode is that stat gets bandied around, bantered, bandied? Bandied, yeah. Bandied around a lot right now, which it's very interesting because the video game market has done this, but the video game market has basically always been larger than TV and movies combined, but has never gotten attention or been thought of as a legitimate form. It's one of those secrets that's been out there for 30 years that people haven't paid attention to. Yeah, all right, I'm afraid of these memory cards filling up. This has been wonderful. Yep, thanks for having me, guys. Listeners, thank you. We almost never say this, but I think we gotta do this again. Let's do it again. I'll be here next week. No. I'm doing great. Thanks, guys. We'll see you next time. All right, bye.
