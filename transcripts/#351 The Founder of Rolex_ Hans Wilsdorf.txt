The book i'm gonna talk to you about today is nearly impossible to find it was first published in nineteen forty six there's only a thousand copies ever made it's called rolex jubilee and then the. Subtitle is actually in latin but when you translate from latin into english it literally means go with me and so it's a tiny for volume like history of rolex and volume one. What is written by hans willsdorf who is the founder of rolex and so he tells the founding story of rolex in his own words there's a lot of things that will surprise you in this story the first one being that he was a soul shareholder of rolex. What the second one was that he was an orphan so he goes right into his early life and in one sentence he sets the entire stage for us he says i was born on march twenty second eighteen eighty one. My mother's early death was soon followed by that of my father's and at age twelve i was an orphan. And there's a decision made by his uncle's that is going to change the trajectory of hans's entire life they decide to sell the family business to pay for boarding school for the kids are left behind my mother's brothers. Decided that be wiser to liquidate the prosperous business which had belong first my grandfather and then later to my father believing that in this way we children could be better prepared for life without having to call upon anyone for help. His life would have been very different without his uncle's and that decision to actually liquidate the business and then take that money and actually send him to boarding school which are getting to why that's so important for the founding rolex in one second. But he talks a little bit about the fact that one of the best things his uncle's ever did for him and his siblings was that they taught him self-reliance. Keep in mind the words i'm reading you hans is writing them he is in his mid sixties he's looking back at his life and so he says our uncle's were not indifferent to our fate. They made me become so for line very early in life looking back i believe that it is to this that much of my success is do. Now this part is really important is gonna be a few times i'm talking today about things that happen early in hans life he doesn't understand so you and i talk about this over and over again. The idea that the world is a classroom like the the the books that you're reading the knowledge and skills that you're acquiring. The relationship for building you have no idea that the opportunities that they unlock in the future you just can't possibly predicted and so. They're gonna put me to boarding school so i'm gonna read this to say why this is so important to the founding of rolex highly likely that. If you learn all these languages at this boarding school that there wouldn't have been a rolex or his career definitely would invest different optics wine one second just replace a boarding school excellent repute. Where we received that sound education so necessary to the man who has to make his own way in the world i showed a particular liking for mathematics and languages languages so important. In this inclination drove me to travel and work in foreign country so this education multiple languages. I would argue is maybe the basis for his entire career it will lead directly to his discovery of the opportunity on which his life and career will then be devoted to. It happens relatively early in his life because at the age of nineteen he is gonna start working in the watch industry at nineteen and he will do so for the next sixty years until death. Now when i say it's the watch industry this is the thing that blew my mind because everybody knows the brand rolex without doubt one of most valuable brand names in existence right. What was no such thing as a wrist watch industry for men at the time that hans is when he's nineteen years old. This is the most one of the most shocking things about me doing read doing all this reading research is one i've been repeating all week to two friends that have been telling about hans and i believe it's to be one of the most inspiring parts of this entire story i'll go into that but. So at nineteen years old right he goes to this little city in switzerland to get he has a job he's gonna work as an english correspondence and a clerk with a swiss company called kuna corten. Now watch how this all ties together so kuna corten it's a swiss company all they do is they export swish pocket watches. The watch industry like ninety nine maybe more than ninety nine percent of the watch industry at this time in history is pocket watches. And so this company they act as import agents this is really important because he spoke because at this point hans speaks english german french i think there's a few other languages that he actually speaks he gets a job where he handles the business correspondence. Of this relatively large import agent for swish watch manufacturers this business is operating in a ton of different countries and a ton of different languages so this helps him get a really good in understanding of international strategic marketing. And i'm not sure there's a better form of education for a young person learning business like when i was reading this section it reminded me exactly of what like a young rockefeller so hans is nineteen where we are in the story. Rockefeller gets a job when he's like sixteen or seventeen for this produce commission firm in cleveland that's called hewlett and tuttle. And as a result of that job rockefeller learned so many valuable skills he understands bookkeeping he understands contracts he's looking at shipping he's learning about margins he's learning skills that he's going to use for his entire career once he starts building his own company. And when you're in a business like rockefeller was in ohio or like hans is in switzerland like you could learn so fast so in the case of hans like he's going to start working here at nineteen by twenty five he starts his own company that that's the company it's going to turn into rolex. And so hans describes the time of his life he says it was a big concern exporting about one million francs worth of watches annually all grades of watches were dealt with although only a small proportion was manufactured by the firm itself so. I need to translate that for you in the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds when you hear the word concern we would call that a company today they would call what we would call product they would call an article. So this import agents business for swiss watch manufacturers was a pretty big business is what he's saying and the next sentence is why I said that decision made by his uncles to educate him to send him to the best school that school teaches them multiple languages why the opportunity to found and develop a rolex. Was unlocked many years in the future and he says my work there provided an excellent opportunity to say the watchmaking industry closely and to examine every type of watch produced both in switzerland and abroad. So a few years later he's going to switch to another firm and move to london and this is what he said about this time he's only going to last two years before he starts his own company. Two things struck me most forcibly that's interesting writing most forcibly about my new employers on one hand their commercial competence and on the other hand their lack of specialization. And now looking back after having done all this other additional reading and research that's it is really important to me because it's not about that they are very commercially competent right in other words they have their shit together they're running a great business. Hans will do the same but then he says their lack of specialization so this is something i've been talking about nonstop this week that is frankly very inspiring to me you see it over and over again stories i think that's why reading business biographies is far superior than reading just business books because in every single life of an entrepreneur. You like grope your way to what you're doing there's all these like false starts dead ends you can just see as you go through not only hans's life but everybody's life is just like you're trying to figure it out a little bit along the way. And they also ape and copy right people have came before them experiences they have before them so when he starts out this is the most inspiring things because like rolex is so unbelievably focused today. They know what they're great at and they focus relentlessly on her but in the very beginning hans had no idea and what i mean by that is he had you know i don't know fifteen different brand names he wasn't making watches at all he was just reselling them is really a gifted marketer which i'll get to in a minute. When you think about lack of specialization is this like their focus on luxury rolex a's fuck your focus on luxury watches he was selling cheap watches you know mid-grade watches really expensive watches he is constantly experimenting. Using that action is a form of education rate gives information back and you see him just slowly overtime and it is true that process that he uncovers are discovers this phenomenal opportunity. And this is when he describes founding the company that's gonna turn into rolex i soon gain confidence in myself. In nineteen five the age of twenty four i decided to set up in business feeling that my training and education had prepared me to stand on my own. And so he starts his company called willsdorf and davis and he says they had my we had modest capital at our disposal so. Will this is fascinating to about you again this is constant iteration that you see throughout the life of hans will start. So willsdorf and davis wasn't they were not watch manufacturers they purchase watches from swish manufacturers think about his experience at work for two firms and exactly so i can do this to write another analogy to rockefeller. Did rockefeller jump from hula and total this produce commission house in the standard no what did you do he quit and started his own whose commission house and then that opportunity. Let him to this accidental discovery of realizing heck and actually become one of the first or finers. So again this is passing so willsdorf and davis are not watch manufacturers they purchase watch watches from the swish watch makers right from swish. I keep saying swish don't know i'm adding an h on there from swiss manufacturers and then would sell them to retailers but i love this idea where he starts out he's just got an office he got no money so what do you do. Can't make yourself just gonna sell when they're talking about their importing watches are talking about pocket watches. If you only remember one thing from this episode the only one thing is like the power of belief the reason rolex is what it is today the reason that we're talking about hans you know what eighty years after you died something like that. It's because his belief this belief in the wrist watch for men which did not exist when he started believing it. Hans is a huge collector of pocket watches which i think is also important working industry he collects pocket watches when you collect something when you see something you see it's flaws and you see what should be improved you see that with the way hans was thinking about. Developing a new market for wristwatches because he saw the deficiency of the pocket watch industry because he was so intimately involved in it so he's describing what the state of this industry was when he was twenty four years old when he started his first company says at this period. The wrist watch so this is hilarious they do not call him wristwatches right they called them either wristwatches they would also call them bracelet watches. And the reason they call them bracelet watches because at this time only women would wear wristwatches. And so he talks about this the fact was for men the wristwatch or the bracelet watch was an object of derision. The idea of wearing a watch on one's wrist was at this time thought contrary to the conception of masculinity. One guy remarked that he would be caught doing such an unrefined thing meaning wearing a watch on his wrist he said he'd be likely to catch him in a dress as you would to be wearing a wristlet. And this sentence says everything prior to World War one wristwatches for men did not exist that blew my mind prior to World War one wristwatches for men didn't exist. And the reason that people are that men in World War one in war wristwatches they were known as trench watches and they did that so they could coordinate movement on the battlefield. That is the very beginning of the wristwatch industry for men. And so Hans talks about the fact that hey you know of course if the public is skeptical then of course the existing players in the industry are going to be skeptical I think this is why it's so important that he was somebody young. Usually people younger coming into industry see they see all the things that all the flaws that they could fix this is watchmakers all over the world remain skeptical. As to its possibilities meaning the wristwatch for men and believe that this newfangled object was bound to prove a failure their argument against the wrist watch. Were the following and their legitimate arguments these are essentially the way you would think about what he's describing here is something you and I've talked about over and over again that problems are just opportunities and workloads business is problems so the best companies are just effective problem solving machines. And so they're like no you have all these unsolved problems first the mechanism required by this type of watch must have necessity be small and delicate and could therefore never withstand the violent gestures of the hand and arm. Second dust and water would rapidly spoil the mechanism he's going to solve that problem to third accuracy and regularity of working could never be attained with such small so small of a movement that's a third problem that he is going to solve. Back to Hans in spite of all of this I kept my faith in the wristlet watch and was determined to see what could be done now this is the crazy thing so he's writing that as a 65 year old man I found a quote. When he is 33 in 1914 this guy really believed in this he says my personal opinion is that the pocket watches will almost completely disappear and that wristwatches will replace them definitively. I am not mistaken in this opinion and you will see that I am right. That is insane he's 33 years old when he's saying that so he says the task I undertook meant the overcoming of enormous difficulties he just laid out all the problems. They were preventing other people from doing this and yet today after 40 years of striving it seems to me that I have surmounted them and I believe that in doing so I've contributed to the development of the watch watchmaking industry in general. And then it gets even more fascinating because then you can tell he's thinking like an entrepreneur you know he wanted to build wealth as you can imagine an orphan wanting to do so right and so he such a he identifies like well this pocket watch. The pocket watch industry is never going to grow because how are we using it at the time pocket watches were passed down from father to son then from son to grandson. And they're also hidden in your pocket and Hans is looking at this is like this is a big problem and so what he realizes like if you could take it out of the pocket and put it on your wrist right there's gonna be more wear and tear but you're also gonna see it so he says. The wristwatch was bound to bring about a certain revolution in the industry it would have to cause an increase in sales not only an account of its novelty but also because by his very nature it called for more frequent renewal. More exposure to damage than the pocket watch. That is actually really shrewd observation is just like well you're gonna buy one pocket watch and it's gonna last for a hundred years. No one sees it it's protected of course this this industry is gonna be so much smaller than the wristwatch industry could be if we can just convince men to wear these damn wristwatches. And then he also had like this shrewd insight to human nature and human psychology because you know it's hidden in your you don't see the product being used but now if I take that product that that was hidden in your coat and I put on your watch what happens becomes a fashion accessory. And so people see it it helps the product spread and so he says the wristwatch is the type of product of which each individual likes to have not only one but several. And then this may be the most important sentence I read from Hans or about Hans because this is incredible sentence because Hans had the highest order bit that other people in the watch industry didn't and that was belief. And this is what he said I had very early realized the manifold possibilities of the wristwatch and feeling sure that they would materialize in time. I resolutely went on my way Rolex was thus able to get several years ahead of other watch manufacturers who persisted in clinging to the pocket watch as their chief product. This is something that cannot be skipped over so Steve jobs had this idea and I heard him say it right before he died this is like two years before he died he was giving this interview that he was on stage with Bill Gates if I remember correctly. But he talked about the highest order bit and so actually had a look that up what did that mean when I heard Steve said it and he's he's he's using a computer reference he says in computing the highest order bit. Also called the most significant bit is the bit position in a binary number having the greatest value and so in Steve's case what he's talking about a stage is the fact that you gotta love what you're doing got a high passion because if you're doing anything that's worthwhile it's so. Difficult that if you don't love it you don't passion you're gonna quit because the people that quit doing things that don't love they're saying people. And that this love and passion for what you're doing can make you in some ways irrational and that irrationality is rewarded because you just don't give up you have this like dog a determination so. I understand who am I going to argue with Steve but I don't know I obviously believe that I'm like completely obsessed with I'm doing but I think actually the highest order bit. It's belief it's belief in yourself and it's belief in your idea and in Hansa story that's certainly the case it wasn't passion and love it was belief that he saw an opportunity and he was willing to pursue it and to actually change. The entire industry and you know what I thought of when I read this section the first thing this I mean this happened instantaneously to which is fascinating because this is one of the most important things I thought of this paragraph in Ted Turner's autobiography is episode 327. And it's just remarkable because Ted is looking at the landscape right he's he's like I'm going to make the world's first 24 hour news network. That idea led him to become a billionaire but he's analyzing this is like what I don't understand this why am I seeing the opportunity that no one else is and so this is from this is the paragraph I thought of when I was reading this. Hans describing the opportunity he saw and this is Ted Turner writing in his autobiography clearly the companies for whom the economics of a 24 hour news network. Would have made the most sense with a big three broadcasters right so ABC CBS NBC why because they already had most of what was needed they had studios they had bureaus they had reporters they had anchors they had almost everything but a belief in cable. Ted Turner had the highest order bit. He didn't have a studio he didn't have the bureaus he didn't have the reporters he didn't have the anchors he'd have to go and collect and build that but he had something they didn't he had a belief in cable. In the crazy thing is like there's a great description of this I gotta read this story because it's hilarious Ted Turner's 38 years old when this story happens. And this guy interviewed in his autobiography is saying that they just happened to wind up being on a plane together they wind up sitting next to each other. And he says as soon as we get airborne Ted pulls out a copy of the Delta lines Delta Airlines magazine he turns to the map United States and starts explaining how he's going to become a billionaire. And he quotes Ted here he goes make sure you buy my stock I'm going to be a billionaire and why and he just lays out this entire thing. And then the story ends perfectly he says his enthusiasm was so genuine and so infectious that I'll never forget it so go back to that this is what a sentence. I had very early realized the manifold possibilities of a wristwatch and feeling sure that they would materialize in time I resolutely went on my way Rolex was thus able to get several years ahead. Of other watch manufacturers who persisted in clinging to the pocket watch as their chief product if I remember correctly Ted Turner had like 11 year head start on everybody else it's absurd. Okay so how does he start acting on this belief I think one thing that's important to understand the story of Hans Wilsdorf is the fact that he understood the opportunity better than anybody else and he would invest heavily in developing the technology that he needed to bring it to fruition. And so again it goes back to this idea that the whole world is a classroom that you never know how your previous experience the things that you're learning will be used in the future this you know knowledge skills relationships all these things compound so. You know years before he found his own company he's working at that firm in Switzerland and he hears about this guy named Herman eggler and Herman's innovation that he made in 1902 was these movements that you need inside of a watch he made movements that would work in smaller watches. And so Hans is going to learn this many years before he's able he has actually the company to actually use it but he says my interest had been roused by this innovation as the mechanism created by a glare right had proved very successful from a technical point of view as well as being accessible in price. So then after founding my firm in 1905 I go and place an order with eggler this was the first step forward in our climbed success so I need to bring there's a bunch of other things I read. To prepare for this podcast I'll leave all of them linked down below I pulled out a bunch of different books but this podcast my friend Patrick did it's one of the best business I guess I've ever heard my life I don't even know how many times I've listened to it now it is an episode of business breakdowns I will link it down below but if you just go in your podcast player look for business breakdowns and then search just search Rolex it has a great name to Rolex timeless excellence my friend Patrick interviewed Ben climber bends the founder of Houdini he got access back in like 2015 he's one of the first people Rolex because they're super super popular. Super secretive but he was one of the first people to actually go and tour all of their for manufacturing facilities so he wrote this fantastic article that I also reread and then he talks a lot about the history of Rolex and then how they operate today but the reason I need to bring this up is because. Aigler is a very important name history of Rolex from the very start of Rolex egg was actually the one manufacturing watches that were sold as Rolex watches. Buying these movements from egg lures what hans describes is his very first step forward in our clients success of the crazy thing the reason I bring this up is cause I also love. Like an old school keep your word mentality so hans and the founder of egg lor had a handshake deal for seventy years. And the deal was that egg lor would make movements solely for Rolex and when they say there's a great line in the podcast episode when he's like when I say an actual handshake deal I mean a handshake deal there was nothing on paper. There was nothing in writing all the way up until 2004 and Rolex finally buys. Aigler undoubtedly undoubtedly at that point to the support Rolex is already making selling you know billions of dollars worth of watches that's not. And I just love that you know two founders of companies coming together say hey we're going to work together. I'm a man of my word we're going to seal this with a handshake. And that relationship and agreement was unbroken for seven decades that's one of the coolest things I've ever heard. And so hans is going to scribe so you have the manufacturing and making a Rolex watches are what's going to be sold under Rolex brand which I haven't got there yet is going to happen in Switzerland he's still in London. So did the design and the sales is separate from the manufacturing and so he would travel from London to Switzerland several times a year and he says I would bring with my collaborators new and personal ideas demanding that they be realized. In this way hundreds of models were conceived and launch all across the world he's selling this again this goes back to the world's entire classroom you have no idea how you're going to use all the experience you have. Remember he was he he worked for an importer they were taking Swiss watches and sending them everywhere so he's just doing the same thing now with his own products. And as we'll see he's a master marketer which I'll get into a minute but he's having immediate success. This is how both a new fashion and a great commercial success sprang from an apparently foolhardy idea he's referencing the fact that everybody around him thought he what he was doing was silly men are never going to wear these watches. Soon we were placing orders for tens of thousands and to the uninformed must have appeared extremely audacious young people when I read that I thought of one of my favorite things Winston Churchover did he had a personal motto that he repeat he would say aloud to himself. Always more audacity Hans when a young man was he was at many things but one of the things he was he was definitely audacious I love the idea it's like these guys are crazy they are extremely audacious young people. And so at this point I need to be clear about something this is not Rolex he's selling under a ton of different brand names he's eventually going to realize hey I don't want to just be sitting in the middle right I don't want to be a middleman I want like all the value creation is going to be if I own my own brand. And this is what I meant about this like constant iteration this trial and error I'm going to read something brand names he had there. And so at this point pre you know doubling down on this fantastic idea of Rolex he hasn't discovered that yet so what he's doing is like there's a bunch of other brand names that he's he's experimenting with he had this idea this is hilarious too because I was reading about this. Because you know Rolex is it now there's I don't even think there's such thing as a cheap Rolex right and so he had this idea is like well I can supply a watch for every pocket and what that means is like let's say you can order you know if I'm making these numbers up like a five dollar watch or a hundred dollar watch or two thousand dollar watch like I want to. I'm going to serve every single aspect of the market which obviously they don't do anymore this is his iteration is like learning from experience I thought he. The note of myself was actually maybe charcoal because I've done a bunch of episodes on these the early automobile industry founders and I go oh Hans was GM General Motors before focusing in on Ferrari like that's the way I think about it. And so listen to some of these brand names I love this because I you know you've heard me struggle with naming stuff all the time and think about last week Steve Jobs the week before Steve Jobs they can call the iMac the Mac man like it's just terrible ideas so I take solace and inspiration with the fact that like oh everybody struggles with this stuff and so even you know Rolex is one of the best names I've ever heard one of the best brands that ever existed and before that he had unicorn Rolco Elvira roll watch Co Falcon Genna. Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex Rolex under its own name that my prospects would be limited. He would just be a middleman, right? And so there's actually a letter that he wrote in 1958 where he's talking about how he came up with Rolex. He had a series of traits that the name had to have for him to select it. And so he said, I needed a short name. It had to be five letters or less because it has to be able to fit. It has to look good on the actual watch. It has to be easy to pronounce in every language. It has to have a good ring to it and it has to be easy to remember. And so when I was thinking about this, it's like how great he did in selecting the name Rolex. If you listen to last week's episode about how Steve Jobs sold, one of the ideas, main ideas from how Steve Jobs communicated, how he sold his ideas to people was that if you can make them ideas easy to understand, then they're easy to spread. Ideas that are easy to understand are easy to spread. And I think you see an echo of that idea with Hans naming and actually picking, like this is the brand that I'm going to build and the one I'm going to invest in for the rest of my life. So now that he has a name, he does something that's really, really smart. Again, this is very uncommon for watchmakers to advertise directly to the public. Not only does he do so, but Rolex continues to do so. So he says, I decided to launch the Rolex trademark by means of an intensive advertising campaign. This policy entailed an annual expenditure of more than 12,000 British pounds, not for one year alone, but for several in succession. So I want to go back to how important this is. I want to go back to that business breakdowns episode on Rolex called Timeless Excellence. So it says Rolex was effectively the first people to have real marketing dollars put behind a watch. Rolex did this in a concentrated way and they have continued to do it in a way that is simply just unmatched by others in their industry. Rolex has been the number one brand for watches in the United States, historically speaking, from the 1950s to today. Now I want to fast forward way ahead in the story. Many, many years after Hans died, because I think this idea is so important and I'm going to show where I've seen this idea. Other people use this idea successfully as well in a different industry. So go back to the transcript from this episode. The financial crisis of 2008, all the other brands, the competitors, you know, Omega, Tag Heuer, all these other brands that are competitors to Rolex. When the financial crisis happens in 2008, they pull back on their marketing. Rolex did not. Rolex put the pedal down and it was really 2008, 2009, 2010, which really elevated Rolex in the United States to a level that it is today. If you speak to them directly, meaning Rolex, the company directly, they'll credit that period as a turning point for them in the U.S. Now what is incredible is Izzy Sharp, who's the founder of Four Seasons. This is episode 184, episode 184. If you haven't listened to it, you should. His autobiography is incredible. Izzy Sharp did the exact same thing. This is what he says in his autobiography, right? Founder Four Seasons. It's tempting during a recession to cut back on consumer advertising. At the start of each of the last three recessions, the growth of spending on such advertising has slowed by an average of 27 percent. But consumer studies of those recessions have showed that the companies that didn't cut their ads had in recovery captured the most market share. It's exactly what happened with Rolex in 2008, 2009, 2010. We did not cut back on our ad budget. This is now Founder Four Seasons again. We did not cut back on our ad budget. In fact, we raised it to gain brand recognition, which continued advertising sustains. It's much easier to sustain momentum than restart it. So think about how important that intuition was. It's like, well, I'm starting a new name. All these other watchmakers are not advertising. Why don't we? Why? Why wouldn't we advertise? It doesn't make sense. Other products are advertised. We should do that. And I'm going to do an intensive, this is the word to use, I'm going to do an intensive advertising campaign. And not just this year, but several years in succession. And then this is nuts. I know I keep saying that because this whole story is nuts because the industry today, in large part to what Hans and Rolex did, is completely different. So at this time, you have your own watch brand, but you don't have your own stores. So you're selling to retailers. At the time, the watch brands don't have the names on the watches. The retailers would buy the watches and put their name on it. And so Hans talks about being one of the first people like, no, no, no, like, I'm going to sell you, I'm going to wholesale my watch and you're going to put my brand name on it, not yours. I think it was like a decade or a decade and a half, if I remember correctly, where he had to fight. And he said something like, you know, when I first started doing this, one out of six, they would agree like one out of six watches could have my name on it. Then it was two out of six, then three out of six, and then finally five out of six. And insisting on doing this is actually really, really important because he also is a perfectionist. And so he realizes like, oh, quality. I said in the Steve, one of Steve Jobs episodes, I just did that quality was his survival strategy. I would say for Hans was this guy, same thing. He's determined to produce the best wristwatch possible. And we'll go into how accurate and the ways he was really smart, like marketing around to. So he thought that was the key to success. Like, I just have to be the best possible. And he's not going to be able to do that unless customers demand that they get a Rolex and not just same watch, which is just renamed by whatever shop they happen to be buying it from and insisting that the name is seen because before the brand name could be seen inside the watch, but no one, the customers are not opening up the watches. And so I think this idea is really, really important. I'm going to read a summary of this entire section to you. He also realized that he would get better orders and more control over the wholesale price of his watches if he could build up demand so that customers would go in the shop and ask for and insist on a Rolex watch by name by his branding and advertising campaigns. Hans effectively turned the tables on the retailers. No longer would he have to approach retailers and ask them to stock his watches. Customers would demand Rolex branded watches and the retailers would have to come to him. So as you already know, I'm obsessed by these people that identify a handful of principles. They know what's important to their business and they just execute on those principles. They repeat them for decades. And that's exactly what Rolex did. That's exactly what Hans did. He had essentially three things that, and it took him, what I'm about to describe to you is going to take two decades maybe to actually fulfill to the degree that he wanted to because remember he starts his company back in 1905. The first waterproof watch is one of his three tenants. This isn't going to happen for 20 years after that. And I think another six years after that till he gets to perpetual. So he has three things that he wants. He goes, I want the watches to be precise, which he handles that problem first. Number two, I want them to be waterproof. And number three, I want them to be self-winding. And so the first thing he does is like, okay, my watch is again, he's a perfectionist. They have to be the best in the world. So he goes to Agler and he's like, how can we improve the timekeeping of the watches? And one thing that Charlie Munger says in Poor Charlie's Dominic is that social proof is a form of leverage. And so what Hans does here is very smart. He insists, he goes to Agler and he's like, hey, I want to get certificates of performance from independent testing establishments. And so these are actually like astronomical observatories. They'll test how good these pieces are at timekeeping essentially. And so there is a letter that Hans writes to Agler in 1912 and he's like, hey, we need to produce a wristwatch that's capable of achieving an observatory timekeeping certificate Two years later in 1914, Agler actually solves that problem for Hans. And so Rolex achieves the first Class A certificate ever to be awarded by an observatory for a wristwatch. This is what Hans says in his autobiography. Another red-letter day, the development of our firm was when a small Rolex wristwatch won a Class A certificate at the famous Q Observatory. This was on July 15th, 1914, and it was a day I shall never forget. He is writing about this 50 years later. And so the reason I brought up what Charlie Munger said is because he uses this social proof, right? Saying, it's funny, I read it, but there's so many fantastic old Rolex ads that were published when Hans was alive. And if you look at them, like a lot of their ads say like the first, the only, so they'll say like the world's first self-winding watch, the world's first waterproof wristwatch. Another ad I found that says the Rolex still remains the only wristwatch in the world to gain certificates at Q. And so if you think about that insistence on this idea to get to become the first to get the certificate, what happens? That makes your ads more effective. It's one form of leverage stacked on another. People are busy if they're in the market for a wristwatch, right? They want to have one that's most accurate. And guess what? There's only one brand in the world that has proven it keeps time so precise that went that extra step to get it tested to get an observatory timekeeping certificate. That is another example of doing as much work as possible for the customers. We talked a lot about the last two weeks for Steve Jobs. Hans is doing the same thing. He just makes it your decision easier. Oh, okay. Oh, I want a precise. Obviously you want a precise wristwatch. Oh, these are the most precise. Okay, cool. That makes my buying decision so much easier. And so that is in 1914. Now he wanted the second part. He's got that three parties. Like I want to be precise. I want to be waterproof. I want to be self-winding. And so this goes back to what I told you about. One of the most important things to understand about Hans is the fact that he understood the opportunity better than anybody else. And he would invest heavily in developing the technology to bring his ideas to fruition. And that means he didn't have to invent it himself. He would buy the inventions of other watchmakers and then combine their ideas with his efforts. And look at how fast he would move. So there's two inventors. They're in Switzerland. They file a Swiss patent and they create the world's first waterproof seal for a wristwatch. The patent is granted and published on May 1926. Hans buys the patent in July. Two months, 60 days later, he already owns the patent. And what does that mean? He owns the patent. So of course, now this new innovation is only exclusive to Rolex watches. You see how he's stacking one advantage over another. He's like, hey, we have the most accurate wristwatch in the world. Here's proof. Oh, now we have this new technology. Guess who owns the patent? We do. You can only get it here. And so this is the creation of the Oyster watch, which still the Oyster classification is waterproof. And so in his autobiography, he's laying out like this is all the problems I had to solve. And this is why I had to solve them in sequential order and how once they're solved, it gives me just an unfair advantage that no one else has. So he says, I'm looking back into the past. I find that in developing and extending my business, I've always had certain aims in mind this course from which I never deviated. Keep the main thing. The main thing is what he's saying. Perhaps these aims can be summarized as follows. Number one, I have to create watches I'm suitable for both men and women. Done. I have to standardize a range of movements of different sizes. Done. Number three, to obtain a high degree of quality that our watches, whatever the caliber caliber should be recognized as chronometers by the observatories. That's the Q certificate. Done. Next one, to maintain this high degree of precision by protecting the movements against the penetration of dust and impurities, the danger to which the wristwatch is particularly exposed. That was why he needed this this patent, this waterproof seal that proved so important. It's going to unlock his abilities to do the perpetual in a minute. But he talks about he tells us in his own words, why this is so important. This last point presented a problem which could only be resolved by protecting the movement against all outside influences. To my technical assistance, my refrain, my constant refrain was from the very earliest days, we must succeed in making a watch case so tight that our movements will be permanently guaranteed against damage caused by dust, water, heat and cold. Only then will the perfect accuracy of the Rolex be secured. Why am I reading this all to you? Because he's going to tell us why this is so important. This seemingly insolvable problem has been solved. The waterproof case was finally created in 1926. This invention was applied exclusively to the Rolex watch. The fact is like an oyster, it can remain an unlimited time underwater without detriment to its parts. The name Rolex oyster has become famous throughout the world. And I love that he said that the name becomes famous because it sets up for the next part. How did the name become famous? Well, remember, Hans is a gifted marketer. He takes an event and he's going to do this multiple times. He takes an event that's already getting a lot of attention and inserts his product and therefore amplifies and leverages that existing attention. And so there was a secretary named Mercedes who had swam the English Channel before she was doing it again. He hears about this. So he's like, okay, where a Rolex oyster around your neck? And so she goes for another attempt. This time she actually fails. She I think she's she gets like 10 hours and then I heard there's like muscle cramps or something like that. But the fact is no one just you already done it. That was like kind of irrelevant to the story because it's still being covered. The fact that she was in this freezing cold water in November, swinging the English Channel and that the Rolex was around her neck. It survived and kept perfect time for the entire 10 hours. And even after the fact of when she was swimming the channel. So what he's do he takes that it's being covered and then he runs this gigantic ad and he has a great line when he describes it. He says that they found the watch was still running as perfectly as it had as if it had never left dry land. And so he says the event caused a sensation at the time for the waterproof watch was still unknown to the general public. November 27, 1927 I reserved the front page of the Daily Mail newspaper at a cost of a ton of money for an ad proclaiming the success of the first waterproof watch. This was the first step in the triumph and rise of the fame of the Rolex oyster. But look at how fast he moves. So this is invented in May 1926. He buys it in July 1926. The next year he takes advantage of this news event. This event that's going to get a ton of eyes on it anyways amplifies his product. That same year in 1927 he goes and creates these window displays and all of the retailers that are now going to sell his watch. And so this is how he describes it. We devised special window displays that which gave the buying public great pleasure. The chief feature was an aquarium with other plants and goldfish and in it was plunged an oyster watch, which was the only watch in the world that was as watertight as an oyster. The same year he gets one of the top British actresses and he starts running ads. The ad is one of the top British actresses. Her hand is in like a goldfish bowl. So half of her arm is in a tank and then you can see that she's wearing the watch. And so he'll use this idea over and over again. And one of the things that Rolex does that's phenomenal is like they always associate with themselves with the very, very best. So another British guy named Malcolm Campbell, he broke like the land speed record in a car like nine different times. And the last time that he did it, Hans learns that Malcolm Campbell had been wearing a Rolex when he broke the speed record. And so then he starts publicizing, he starts running ads broadcasting that during this record breaking land speed attempt, the driver was wearing a Rolex. So Hans is doing this in the 1920s. He does this until he dies. He does this over and over again. He wanted to place Rolex watches on the wrist of as many high profile people like extreme achievers. He would go around and identify these leaders or these high achievers and he would gift them Rolexes and then they'd be photographed wearing them. Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower before and during that he got elected to the American presidency. And keep in mind, he's giving these watches to Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower. This is post-World War II. He's aiming straight to the top, the greatest leaders in World War II. There's an actual ad that's run around this time that was excellent. The tagline is, men who guide the destinies of the world wear Rolex watches. Chuck Yeager, the pilot who broke the sound barrier for the very first time, he was wearing a Rolex watch. That was an ad. The expedition that first summited Mount Everest, some of the people on the team were wearing Rolexes the same year they get to the deepest level. Another team went to like the, at the time, the deepest level that a human had gotten 10,000 or 12,000 feet underneath. And so they run an ad from the top of the world to the bottom of the sea. Rolex proves dependable. But this constant positioning of Rolex is the very top. We are only associated with the very best. You go and look at these taglines, it would say over and over again, Rolex, the masterpiece of watch craftsmanship, sold exclusively by quality jewelers. So I'll come back to the ads because I really think that studying the advertising and marketing of Hans, like he was a legit genius in this domain, but I want to, I'll come back to that. I want to go back to that third pillar that he was trying to do. So he starts off with number one, I want the watches to be precise. He's done that. Number two, I want them to be waterproof. He's done that. Now he says, I want them to be self winding, which he's going to call perpetual. And so not only is this an example of him, him having to solve another long standing problem, but it is another example of something that pops up in the books that you and I talk about the fact that opportunity unlocks more opportunities in the future. So he talks about in his autobiography, he's like, listen, the creation of the perpetual watch whose movement is self winding and guaranteed to run without interruption. This idea of course had preoccupied many famous horologists of the past. I am not a watch guy. I don't own any watches. My wife has a hard enough time getting me to wear a wedding ring. I'm very minimalist, right? So I didn't know what the hell that word was. So I looked it up. All that is, is a horologist is just a person or a company that makes or repairs clocks and watches. They're also referred to throughout history as a clockmaker. So what Hans is telling us is like, listen, this is not, I wasn't the first person to notice this as a problem. I was the first person to solve it. And I wouldn't have been able to solve it if I didn't solve the waterproofing first. He said the waterproof watch had in itself marked a great step forward towards the realization of this new achievement. An automatic watch can function with the utmost regularity only if the movement is placed in a waterproof case. What he's telling you is oyster unlock the opportunity for perpetual. It had been my belief that the watch of the future is the perpetual watch. In other words, the automatic or self winding watch in this field to Rolex has been a pioneer without the waterproof watch, the perpetual could never have been discovered. And so I need to repeat that because it's so important without the waterproof watch, the perpetual could never have been discovered. Now something's also interesting. This is like a centuries old problem. They're going to run a fantastic ad talking about like, about how they solve this, this century old problem. And there's a great line that I found in this Rolex blog that talks about this as inventing the automatic wristwatch that could wind itself was the dream of the ages in the watch world for centuries. Many famous watchmakers had tried to perfect the automatic or self winding watch, but none were successful. There's an important principle here that you and I can apply to our own work. And the fact that the more work that you do for the customer, the easier you can make for the customer, the greater the market can be. So before I read this section about why this is so important, because you know, why I'm constantly winding a watch is a pain in the ass. It's not convenient. It's not as convenient as a perpetual watch. Steve Jobs put this best when he was talking about the difference of, you know, this hobbyist culture in the early like personal computer industry. And he says, my vision was to create the first fully packaged computer. We were no longer aiming for the handful of hobbyists who liked to assemble their own computers, who knew how to buy transformers and keyboards. For every one of them, there were a thousand people who would want the machine to be ready to run. In other words, if we can make this easier, we can expand the market by a thousand. Turns out he drastically under underestimated that. Probably expanded the market by 10 million or a hundred million or whatever the crazy number is. And so when Rolex creates this perpetual automatic watch, it eliminates the need to ever wind a watch again. So they run this incredible ad that the headline is master horologist's dream is realized 104 years after his death. And it tells the history of this guy in theory had invented the world's first self winding watch. But what he actually made was imperfect in practice. And now us Rolex, the only watch company in the world has perfected. They essentially honor him. They say he was a great watchmaker, maybe the greatest ever. And now his dream is finally realized 104 years after his death. And it was realized by Rolex. Oh, by the way, do you want one? And then right before Hans dies, he gives this interview and I found a transcript that was translated from French. And I think he does a wonderful job summarizing the impact that his 60 year career had on the industry that he in large part created. I entered the watch business as a young man at 19 years of age. It was 60 years ago when wristwatches didn't exist. Wristwatches for men didn't exist at all. Men wore pocket watches, which went from father to son and son to grandson. And the opportunity for the watch industry to grow was extremely limited as sales were very slow. As a young man, I understood it would be very difficult to obtain results in an industry that had little chance to make lots of money. Watches were cheap and the quality was not very good, especially since there was no factory able to produce small watches, which was necessary for wearing them on your arm. The wristwatch was the peak of my career as I foresaw the total development of the wristwatch for the Swiss watch industry. I can say I was one of the initiators in the whole watch industry. I was not only the first to understand the potential of the wristwatch, but I also made personal efforts which contributed largely to the development of the industry. I think it's absolutely incredible to be able to hear the words of somebody who had six decades of experience in this industry. And then the last idea I want to leave you with, I think speaks to just how unique Hans and his story truly is. In 1944, Hans set up the Hans Wilsdorf Trust, which owns and controls Rolex to this day. He brilliantly set up the bylaws of his trust so Rolex could never be sold or made public, so it would never have to worry about catering to anything but making timeless watches. If you think about it, this means Hans's vision is still very much alive and being executed on a daily basis despite the fact that he passed away more than half a century ago. How many people can you think of that build a world-class business and 50 years after they pass away, the company keeps going as if they were still running it? And that is where I'll leave it. As far as buying the book, I can only find one copy available, it's like $500, but there is a series of other sources that I used for this podcast that I highly recommend. I'll link all these Rolex enthusiast blogs, which I thought were fantastic. I also use subjects or ideas rather from the book, The Luxury Strategy, which I highly recommend. It reads like a textbook, but it's actually fascinating. The subtitles break the rules of marketing to build luxury brands. I'll probably do an episode on it in the future. And then of course, what I would do now is listen to that Business Breakdowns episode on Rolex called Timeless Excellence. It covers the history of Rolex, but also how they operate the business in present day. It'll blow your mind. So I will leave that link down below or you can just search Business Breakdowns Rolex and it'll come up in your podcast player. That is 351 books down, 1000 to go, and I'll talk to you again soon. I have a few quick updates before you go. If you're an existing subscriber to Founders Notes, you got a new feature. A new feature was added for you this week. I actually combined the Founders AMA private podcast feed with Founders Notes. So make sure that you log into Founders Notes and grab your personal private podcast feed. You'll find 50 short episodes waiting for you. I am likely renaming that private feed to Sage Advice because the private podcast feed is going to be updated with new episodes and all the episodes that I'm making for that feed are going to be really short and focused on one topic. These are going to be extremely concise, much more scripted than like a normal Founders episode ever is. I want them focused on one thing. So it could be like a subject like leadership. How did history's greatest founders think about leadership, for example, or about like a person like the best ideas of James Dyson, for example. So you'll find instructions on how to easily set up your private feed when you log into Founders Notes. And so there's an idea. I want to tell you my thinking about this. How am I thinking about this has been influenced by some of the books that I've been reading and obviously the podcast I've been making. And so over the last few weeks and including the Rolex episode that you just heard, this idea that each product should have a single idea that is expressed clearly that describes why somebody should care. Always written from the point of view of the person using the product. The single idea expressed clearly should describe what the product does for them. And that two part series on Steve Jobs I just covered is like a master class in that because he was one of the best in the world ever at doing this and he did it intentionally. There's a lot of quotes in those episodes where he's like, no, you have to work. Start with the customer and then work backwards. And you see how much time and effort he took into just editing his thinking, just making sure that he had the single idea expressed clearly. We see Hans Wilser was the same thing where he's just like, well, what was the most important thing that he wanted to convey to his customers? He's like, we have the most precise watches in the world. They're waterproof. So you don't have to worry about exposing the elements because they're not in your pocket anymore and they're on your arm and they're perpetual. They're automatic. You never have to wind it. And then he just constantly drilled down and perfected on those three ideas decade after decade after decade. And you fast forward 50, 60 years after he died. And Rolex is one of the most pri- the most valuable private companies in the world. And so, of course, the entire reason that Founders Podcast exists is so we can use, we can learn from history's greatest entrepreneurs, realize, hey, these, these in Hans's case, he worked for six decades. Turns out over six decades, you come up with some good ideas and then take those principles and hopefully apply to what we're doing. So I think I've really narrowed that down and I'll keep working on it. But like, why does Founders Notes exist? Like, why the hell? This is a private internal tool that I've been using for years. Why would I externalize that and make it available to other people? Like, what, why would you care about that? And the reason is also embedded in the main reason that Founders Podcast exists because Charlie Munger hits on it. Just like Charlie Munger, just like almost every single person you and I cover, they all spent their very valuable time. These are some of the wealthiest people in the world. Spent their very valuable time studying and learning from great people that came before them. Why? And Charlie Munger said best, he said that learning from history is a form of leverage. And Founders Notes gives you the superpower to do this on demand. Founders Podcast is a fantastic tool to learn from history, but it's pushed to you. Founders Notes give you the ability to control it. It gives you the ability to tap into that collective knowledge of history, education, entrepreneurs when you need it. And that's why I think it's valuable for you to have access to this giant searchable database of all my notes, all my highlights, all my transcripts. So if the single idea expressed clearly for Founders Notes overall is, hey, learning from history is a form of leverage. Founders Notes gives you the superpower to do this on demand. What is the single idea expressed clearly? Why does Sage, this new private podcast feed, why does Sage advice need to exist? In other words, what am I selling? And the more I thought about it is like, oh, I'm selling time because what I'm going to do with this private podcast feed that is now included with your subscription to Founders Notes is I'm going for a maximum insight to time ratio. I love this idea that you could have an entrepreneur that spends, let's say, 40 years building their company. I can then spend 40 hours reading and researching their life and career and then distill that for you down to, let's say, 10 minutes, 10 minutes of audio that you can do on demand, download those ideas into your brain while your eyes are busy. So that is my North Star. That is my goal. As with everything else, as my thinking evolves, I will keep you updated. If you do not yet have a subscription to Founders Notes and you are spending hours and hours listening to the podcast, I highly recommend that you subscribe and you can do so by going to Founders Notes. That's Founders Notes with an S, foundersnotes.com. And the second thing that I want to tell you about is this Founders event that I'm hosting. July 29th through the 31st in Scotts Valley, California. It is this beautiful venue deep in the California redwoods. And the single idea expressed clearly around why do these events need to exist is because I want to help high value people build relationships with each other. I did this back at the first Founders event in March in Austin. And I'm doing it again, July 29th through the 31st in Scotts Valley, California. And I'm doing this event in partnership with my friend Rick and Paul. They're the founders of Seder Grove, which is this $500 million permanent holding company. They're also the host of this podcast called Art of Investing. But the reason I'm partnering with these guys is because they are world class at building relationships. They understand the direct link between building relationships and value creation. And I know this because I know them personally as friends. I talk to them all the time, but you can also see this if you just you can see this publicly. Look at their podcast feed. If you go to Art of Investing's podcast feed, listen to the one that they just did with Mitch rails. Mitch rails is the co-founder of Dan here. He is one of the greatest living entrepreneurs and investors on the earth today. In his 40 year career, Mitch had never given a single long form interview. And he chose to do his very first one, which you can listen to as a podcast with two of his most trusted collaborators and friends. Somebody he speaks to multiple times a week. That is Rick and Paul. Rick and Paul were at the first Founders event in March. Multiple people that were at that event met them and have since built relationships with them. They did not know who Rick and Paul were before they went to the Founders event in March. And I've heard from multiple people that are now calling texting, zoom, getting on zoom, going in person and meeting and spending time with Rick and Paul because they're learning from Rick and Paul how to build a permanent capital holding company. One of the breakout sessions that we're going to have at this event on July 29th, the 31st is going to be led by Rick and Paul. They're going to talk about how to build a new investment firm, a new permanent capital holding company and how established firms can actually sustain excellence way before they were doing this way before they founded their own company. They had studied and helped hundreds of the world's greatest investors. They literally wrote case studies on some of these. They wrote an incredible case study on one of the greatest compounders of all time, which is Julian Robertson of Tiger Management. And by going and looking at their podcast feed, you can see some of the people they developed these really good relationships like Todd Combs from Berkshire, my friend Ho Nam from Altos Ventures. Relationships run the world. And I think Rick and Paul are a great illustration of that. I think their session, I think the entire event will be hugely valuable for any investor. There's a ton of founders coming. There's investors, there's executives coming. But specifically, if you are interested in developing a new investment firm and learning more lessons from established firms that sustained excellence over multiple decades, highly recommend coming to the event and making sure you don't miss the breakout session taught by Rick and Paul. Another thing I want to mention to you about these events that's really important is they're all inclusive. That means if you get yourself to the event, you don't have to worry about anything else. I ran out the entire venue. Every single person, there's nobody else that's on the property that's not part of the event. So every single person, if you attend, every single person you see there is there for the same reason as you. That person has the same interest. They're fellow business nerds. We're all business nerds. And so that's why we gathered together. Again, that is July 29th through the 31st. It's a private venue deep in the California Redwoods. It is beautiful. And the reason that it exists, again, that single idea expressed clearly that you and I have been talking about for the last few weeks that I don't think I'll ever forget. Why does this exist? This exists to help you build relationships with other high value people. And that is important because that opens up opportunities in the future that you can never possibly predict. So I hope you come to this event and build relationships with other founders, listeners, other high value people. The first thing you need to do if you want to attend, you go to founderspodcast.com forward slash events and apply. And that's it for me. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much for the extra support and I'll talk to you again soon.
