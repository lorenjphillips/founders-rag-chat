--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made this mini podcast a few months ago. I'm posting it again in case you missed it because I think it's a great explanation of why Founders Podcast exists and what you would get out of listening to the full episodes. Most people would be surprised to know how much time and effort Steve Jobs put into learning from great company builders that came before him and how much that studying benefited his career. I hope listening to this will encourage you to upgrade and start listening to full episodes of Founders. Apple was founded 45 years ago today and when I read that I had the idea to do just a quick little episode for you that highlights the almost 40 different episodes of Founders that I've done on Steve Jobs are the people that he was influenced by or looked up to. And the reason I wanted to do that is because I think Steve Jobs is one of the best illustrations of why Founders Podcast exists and that's because Steve, like every single other of history's greatest entrepreneurs, all spent an excessive amount of time studying from and learning from the great people that came before them and then use the ideas that they learned through that practice of study and reading to use those ideas in the company that they wind up building. And that is exactly why Founders exists. If you listen to Founders you are able to download into your brain the very best ideas of all of history's greatest entrepreneurs and their worst mistakes that you can avoid. And so the fact that you're hearing this that means you're not currently on the Misfit feed and that means you're only hearing partial episodes of Founders. You just hear about the first 30 minutes of some of the episodes that I've done. In order to access full episodes you'll need to sign up by tapping the link that's in the show notes of your podcast player or by going to founderspodcast.com and once you do that you get immediate access to 247 full-length episodes that are available nowhere else and I add more episodes every week. Every episode is ad free and it takes less than 29 seconds to set up. And so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go through about I think there's like 37 episodes on this list that are related to either Steve Jobs himself or people he studied. I will leave all of the episode title and episode numbers in the show notes so if you sign up you can start with these episodes. It gives you like a fantastic blueprint or fantastic roadmap to start going through this extensive back catalog of Founders because I've spent four years about 6,000 hours and I've read over 100,000 pages so it's just to so I can document and search for the very best ideas in the history of entrepreneurship. I've distilled what I learned down to roughly about 400 hours and by listening to the episodes I'm about to talk to you about it'd be impossible for you to listen to them learn the the best ideas from these extremely talented some of the smartest most productive people to ever live and not get a return on your investment when you apply these ideas to your work. So I'm just going to start first I'm going to talk about the ones that are specifically on Steve Jobs and so the very first episode I ever did on Steve Jobs was number five is based on Steve Jobs's biography it was written by Walter Isaacson and this is where it really blew my mind because as I'm reading this book and Steve is working with the author with Walter Isaacson and he knows he's dying and in this book Steve introduced me to so many other founders I didn't even know existed and he goes through at length about all the people that he admired the people that he wanted to pick their brain the one he read books about what it was what what what inspired him and what ideas of theirs that he used to build Apple so that's number five number 19 if I if you could only read let's say you only had time to read one biography of Steve Jobs this is the one I would recommend and that's this is so this is number 19 the book is called Becoming Steve Jobs the evolution of a reckless upstart into a visionary leader and it was published after the Isaacson's biography so it also builds on some of what Isaacson wrote about and what I loved about this book is it shows in the subtitle says the evolution of a reckless upstart into a visionary leader Steve Jobs was not born as one of the greatest entrepreneurs ever lived he made himself he built himself into that person and so this book spends a lot of time talking about how he the mistakes he was making in his 20s and 30s and how he corrected he had the ability to constantly was a learning machine he had the ability to constantly learn and correct his behavior and without making those mistakes and making and learning from his struggles we would have never had things like the ipod the iphone the ipad the imac all of the the things that now the the gigantic apple empire sits upon and the book also has a fantastic introduction written by Mark Andreessen if you go and look at the description I have a quote from Mark Andreessen as the description of why I created founders and it's actually a quote I heard from Mark Andreessen in a different interview and he talks about like why he's read hundreds of biographies even to the states guy's a multi multi billionaire he spends his ton of time reading he has an like this this comprehensive historical base of knowledge that helps him succeed in his work and this is what Mark said about why he read and read and continues to read so many biographies he says there are thousands of years of history in which lots and lots of very smart people worked very hard and ran all types of experiments on how to create new businesses invent new technology new come up with new ways to manage etc they ran these experiments throughout their entire lives at some point somebody put these lessons down in a book for very little money in a few hours of your time you can learn from someone's accumulated experience there is so much more to learn from the past than we often realize you could productively spend your time reading experiences of great people who have come before you and learn every time so that's the end of the quote what I loved is when the pandemic happened and everybody was working from home working remotely I watched a few interviews that Mark did in his house and this guy the reason I point out the fact he's a multi-billionaire is not to glorify his wealth per se it's the fact that at that level you can learn from whoever you want you can hire the world's experts you could do whatever you want and he chooses he's showing us by his actions that how valuable reading and learning from biographies is and it's just hilarious you'd watch these videos of him and it's just Mark in his house he doesn't have bookshelves like he's his book collection has outstripped his shelves you just have stacks of books on top of each other uh throughout his living room and wherever he's doing these interviews and I just like all right this is this I'm clearly on the right path like this is clearly a very high value activity that we need to keep going on so anyways Mark and Mark and Jason wrote the the the introduction to becoming Steve Jobs it's a fantastic book highly recommend reading it listen to the podcast first it's very helpful to read to listen to the podcast first and then read the read the biographies a lot of people that that listen to founders do that and they say it really adds to their understanding and they're they're like the it makes the ideas that they learn stick even more then we go to number 76 and don't worry about if you don't remember all these numbers like I said I'll list it down below as well number 76 this is this is crazy book too it's called return to the little kingdom Steve Jobs and the creation of apple so apple was founded in 1976 45 years ago today like I said this book is written by Michael Moritz at the time Michael Moritz was a like a journalist for Time magazine he wrote this book it covers the first six years like a snapshot because it was it was a lot of the books I do on the podcast you'll see they're very very old books a lot of them are very hard to find that's another advantage that founders gives you very few people are reading these books very few people are like you just have a complete edge because everybody's focused on like what's happening now what's what are entrepreneurs doing now and you're like why are you doing that not why are you doing that but like the greatest people in history studied the people that came before them it's not that they don't pay attention what's going on now but you like if you have to choose between let me listen to a podcast interview with an entrepreneur that's operating today or let me study a great entrepreneur in the past it's no question like the greatest entrepreneurs will tell you choose the history first it's not either are you can do both and you should do both but without question you should be studying you should be building your own historical base of knowledge first that's what all of these people did so anyways the reason that this is interesting is because the book is first of all very very old and it shows at the end of the book we don't know like Steve Jobs had not been kicked out of apple yet he's still in his 20s we don't know what apple is going to turn into and then there's an also an interesting point where Michael Moritz he winds up after that book he winds up transitioning from a journalist and a reporter to a venture capitalist and fast forward to today and he's actually a billionaire because he was really successful at investing in technology companies because that's what he was studying number 77 this is Steve Jobs and the next big thing this is also an important book and also a very old book because it could it could it only it's another snapshot in Steve Jobs career and it only covers the 13 years between when he got kicked out of apple and when he returns these are known and referenced as Steve Jobs wilderness years the reason this book is important to the podcast is important to listen to and the book is important to to read is because you have what is arguably one of if not the greatest entrepreneur to ever live making one bad decision one stupid decision after another it is i call it i think on the podcast i said it's like bizarro Steve Jobs all the other books are like copy these ideas because Steve like they're they're genius ideas this is learn these lessons and do the opposite it is crazy how you could have somebody so smart and so talented and i think it's important for all of us to remember that they're no one's perfect right even the people that have wild success and so this book is just it's just fantastic because let me give you one example you you know when you're they Steve talks over over and over again about how important it is to to make sure you have the highest talent level especially at the beginning your company because when you're starting a company when the company's small it is affected by the quality of talent that it has more than a large company is because let's say you have 10 people and you hire two bad apples well 20 of your company sucks he Steve Jobs one of the first 10 hires at next had nothing to do with software nothing to do with hardware he hired an interior designer for his office that's not that's not a joke that's that's a gigantic mistake the book is again fantastic very old book very few people now like your competitors are probably not reading that book this gives you an advantage number 204 inside Steve Jobs brain this book was written after he uh after he came back to apple the second time but before he died it's absolutely fantastic number 214 i reread this is also important not just to read a book once or listen to a podcast once but you go back and you reread great books you go back and you re-listen to podcasts or great podcast that's it that is because the book stays the same the podcast stays the same but you change as a person now you've learned a ton like in between reading this book the first time is number five this is number 214 that's 209 books i read that adds and knowledge compounds just like money does and so now i pick up the book the the words on the page haven't changed but i've changed drastically and so you start to notice things you didn't notice the first part so that's 214 then number 235 is to Pixar and beyond my unlikely journey with Steve Jobs to make entertainment history most of what i focus on is the fact that the building of apple right but Steve Jobs became a billionaire not from apple the first time he became a billionaire was from Pixar he dumped 50 million dollars into Pixar before it made a dollar so this book is written by the first CFO of Pixar he talks about what it was like to build that company into an asset a business that was good enough to sell to Disney a couple years later for almost eight billion dollars and the fact is we learn a lot about Steve's approach to company building in that book and one of the craziest things is when Steve hires the guy who is the Pixar's first CFO and he writes the book after he leaves leaves Pixar obviously he's looking at the books he's like wait a minute we're losing money every month and Steve Jobs has put in 50 million dollars of his own money and this is not billionaire Steve Jobs he had somewhere between like 70 and 80 million dollars to thereabouts this is not exact number when he left apple he put almost all of it and he was at next at the time so his company was it wasn't doing well right just before he went back to apple put all of it almost all of it into Pixar and he just had the patience and the belief that what that he had a small group of geniuses and they were going to change history and they wound up doing that then I have two bonus episodes so I've done I don't know like 10 bonus episodes somewhere like that eventually I wised up and realized I should number the bonus episodes just like every other episode so you could actually find them so the two I did on Steve Jobs was before I realized I should number them and I was like oh I just won't number them because they're bonus episodes but it's a bonus episode or not every single episode before I sit down like founder's one of the craziest podcasts that you'll ever come across like there's no other podcast like in the world think about how crazy the preparation before I sit down to talk to you I have to read an entire book and it's not like I'm taking long times between making new podcasts I did 66 new podcasts last year like it's just insane the amount of the preparation I have to do so this the first book is insanely simple the obsession that drives apple success you can find it between episodes number 112 and episodes number 113 it is written by somebody it was written by somebody worked at the ad agency that Steve Jobs used and he taught he gives us and he's like this is what I observed what makes Steve special the the ideas that he used that were completely different because this guy is not only working for apple he's working for all these other technology companies and he's like there's nobody else that thinks like apple so he writes an entire book about what are what are these unique these unique things that he's unique perspectives and ideas that Steve used fantastic book then the other bonus happens this book anybody building a product I've read this book three times it's called creative selection inside apple apple's design process during the golden age of Steve Jobs it is written by a programmer at apple it is you can find it between episodes number 110 and 111 it's you can read it in a weekend I would buy it right now even if even if you don't sign up for for founders and I think not signing up for founders is a gigantic gigantic mistake the value to cost ratio is insane just read I'll leave some reviews down below if you want to read what other people say it's it's absolutely crazy but this book is just fantastic gives you an insight into what it was like like this the author literally had to do product demos to Steve over and over again he helped build the first keyboard for the iphone he helped build a safari browser it's just there's gold there's like gem after gem after gem in that book okay now there's a series of other books I'm going to tell you about that have to do with a person that worked very closely with Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs so the first one is Johnny Ive and Steve Jobs I read Johnny Ive's biography it's number 178 Johnny Ive the genius behind apple's greatest products I just found out that when Johnny Ive worked at at apple after Steve came back he what he there's only one person in the entire Steve set up the company so there's only one person in the entire company until that could tell Johnny what to do and that was him and his base salary Johnny Johnny's base salary was 30 million dollars a year that's how valuable Steve thought he was so anyways that's number 178 Johnny Ive the genius behind apple's greatest products another fantastic book number 34 creativity inc overcoming the unseen forces forces that stand in the way of true inspiration this is the co-founder Steve's co-founder of Pixar Ed Catmull who's by all accounts a managing managerial genius and also the person that worked the longest consecutive time with Steve Jobs it was either 24 or 26 years straight I don't have the book in front of me so it's one of those the end of this book there's there's like a 30 page afterward or 20 page afterward called the Steve we knew it's absolutely fantastic but you can learn a lot from Ed in general but there's also Steve's you know obviously a main character in that book and in the podcast now there's two other books I read that are on Steve Jobs and several other technology company founders number one or excuse me number 157 the innovators how a group of hackers geniuses and geeks created the digital revolution there's like 25 mad geniuses in there Steve's in there a lot and a lot of Steve's heroes are in there as well and then the other one is another example book on Steve Jobs and several other technology company founders is number 208 in the company of giants candid conversations with visionaries of digital world two MBA students at Stanford in the last in the late 90s decided to write a book and they took for the entire book is just interviews with Steve and I think 15 other technology company founders like Bill Gates is in there Steve Case like just flat out geniuses and so obviously if you listen number 208 you'll learn a lot from Steve Jobs and other people as well now I want to get into Steve's influences these are the people that he talks about over and over and over again he has this this world famous quote when Steve said Picasso had a saying good artists copy great artists steal and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas but it's not that he just steals them he gives them he gives credit to who these people are so the most important person I would study all these people because they're they're also very formidable individuals in their own right but the person that has the single largest influence on apple is this guy I didn't know who I didn't know about him right before I started doing this project his name is Edwin Land he was the founder of Polaroid he ran Polaroid for like 60 years and he was Steve Jobs hero Steve got to meet him Edwin was Edwin Land at the time was like in the 70s Steve was in his 20s and he said visiting Edwin Land was like visiting a shrine I was shocked when I started reading and I've read five books on Edwin Land for the product for the podcast I was shocked how many ideas I I thought I had learned from Steve Jobs that he just learned that he literally regurgitated and learned from Edwin Land so number 40 insisting on the impossible the life of Edwin Land and there's another book so on some episodes I read two books number 40 is an example that so I read insisting on the impossible life of Edwin Land my opinion the best biography of Edwin Land number and then instant the story of Polaroid so one's a biography of Edwin Land one's the history of Polaroid obviously there is no Polaroid without Edwin Land it's literally like he was the company then number two the three more episodes on Edwin Land number 132 the instant image Edwin Land and the Polaroid experience number 133 Land's Polaroid a company and the man who invented it and number 134 a triumph of genius Edwin Land Polaroid and the Kodak patent work so right there because these are some giant books right there that is probably if I had to guess almost 2,000 pages just on Edwin Land that I went through then we go through one of Steve Jobs mentor two two of his mentors were the two co-founders of Intel so technically the two co-founders of Intel were Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore but really Andy Grove was considered an unofficial co-founder and really one of the most important probably the most important CEO of Intel so Bob Noyce and Andy Grove Steve Jobs talks about over and over and over again Steve when he's a young kid Bob Noyce was like the godfather of Silicon Valley at the time he'd go he was in his 20s he'd just show up at Bob Noyce's house and just have just to have dinner with his family and stuff like it was hilarious and Bob Noyce would constantly like you know chastising Steve about his bad manners and just the way he talks and everything but Bob Noyce Andy Grove so number eight the episode number eight the Intel Trinity how Robert Noyce Gordon Moore and Andy Grove built the world's most important company number 166 the man behind the microchip Robert Noyce and the invention of Silicon Valley so it's Bob Noyce's biography and then 159 is the autobiography of Andy Grove and it's one of the craziest autobiographies because he winds up it's you know what I'll just read you I'm going to read you one of the opening paragraphs of the book it's beautifully written it only covers the first 21 years of his life but he says I was born in Budapest Hungary in 1936 by the time I was 20 I lived through a Hungarian fascist dictatorship so this is everything happened to him before he turned 20 I lived through a Hungarian fascist dictatorship German military operation the Nazi's final solution the siege of Budapest by the Soviet Red Army a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war a variety of repressive communist regimes and a popular uprising that was put down at gunpoint he winds up escaping Hungary and making it to United States and then becoming one of the most important founders and managers in the technology industry history by far but there's also a fantastic story that Steve Jobs tells in other books why Andy Grove was so important to his decision to return to Apple because at the time he just well I'll read this this is Steve Jobs talking about this and and this gives you an idea of Andy Grove's like blunt no bullshit style so says we just taken Pixar public and I was happy being CEO there I never knew any of anyone who served as a CEO of two public companies even temporarily and I wasn't even sure it was legal I didn't know what I wanted to do I was enjoying spending time this is all Steve Jobs talking by the way I was enjoying spending more time with my family I was torn I knew Apple was a mess so I wondered do I want to give up this nice nice lifestyle that I have what are all the Pixar shareholders going to think so I talked to people I respected I finally called Andy Grove I gave him the pros and the cons and in the middle he stopped me and said Steve I don't give a shit about Apple I was stunned it was then I realized I do give a shit about Apple I started it and it's a good thing to have in the world that was when I decided to go back so that's number 159 is Andy Grove's autobiography Nolan Bushnell next person Nolan Bushnell is Steve Jobs one of Steve Jobs mentors he was the founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese he Steve worked at Atari Nolan Bushnell hired Steve when Steve was 19 years old and so this entire book they met up in Paris in 1980 at the time Atari and Chuck E. Cheese is way bigger than Apple is and they they wind up taking a walk for several hours and talk and Nolan and Steve are talking about the difficulties of building companies that conversation the ideas that came out of that conversation Nolan turned into a book it's number 36 it's called finding the next Steve Jobs how to find keep and nurture talent next person it's the founder of Sony Akia Morita not only did Steve steal ideas from him he loved Akio they went to meeting Akio also influenced heavily Jeff Bezos as well he's got an unbelievable story one of the best founders to ever do it by far number 102 made in Japan Akio Morita and Sony this is autobiography it's fantastic Walt Disney it's another huge influence on Steve Jobs he loved his dedication to the quality of his product innovation and more importantly that he built a company to last and that is right before he died that's what his most important thing he's like I'm not worried about money not worried about any of that I want to build my goal was to build insanely great products and to build a company that will last that would that's what my heroes like Walt Disney Bob Noyce all these other people did that's what I want Apple to be so Walt Disney's number two Walt Disney the triumph of American imagination number 39 Walt Disney and American original and number 158 Walt Disney and the invention of the amusement park that changed the world that was a really good book because it's all about Walt Disney's end of his life he was dying of lung cancer he said he was most proud of two things starting a company and keeping control of it and number two Disneyland that was the favorite thing you ever worked on in that book on 158 it's all about the creation of Disneyland another person from history that might surprise you that Steve Jobs studied and learned from was J. Robert Oppenheimer one of the leaders of the Manhattan project he said he learned from J. Robert Oppenheimer the importance of only having the most talented people on your team that you have to be ruthless in the quality the level of talent and so that is number 215 the general and the genius Groves and Oppenheimer the unlikely partnership that built the atom bomb I read that book because Steve Jobs said that he studied and learned from Oppenheimer so if Steve learned from Steve studied and learned from Oppenheimer why wouldn't I why wouldn't you I mean this is just these are just like the biggest no-brainer in the world right Henry Ford another one of Steve Jobs heroes one of my favorite entrepreneurs I read five different books on Henry Ford when Jobs is building the Macintosh he's in his early 20s he's saying he wanted to make it as simple as Henry Ford's Model T and there's all these other ideas that he took from Henry Ford number nine I invented the modern age the rise of Henry Ford number 26 Henry Ford's autobiography my life and work number 80 another book Henry Ford wrote called today and tomorrow number 118 my 40 years of Ford this is like one of Henry Ford's right-hand guys worked for him for 40 years named Charles Sorensen that book is fantastic a lot of crazy Ford stories in the book and then number 190 the story of Henry and Thomas Edison's 10-year road trip Thomas Edison was Henry Ford's hero and they wind up later in life becoming almost like best friends so again everybody has heroes everybody learns from somebody founders just exists to make this easier so you can do it easier and faster and if you pick the right heroes it's going to change the trajectory of your life for sure Steve Jobs says they had a heavy heavy influence on him was the HP way which was Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett they built one of the very first technology companies Silicon Valley back in like the 1930s and a lot of people copied their management structure Steve Jobs copied their management structure he calls it the HP way just so happens that Dave Packard wrote a biography and he titled it the HP way the HP way helped Bill Hewlett and I built our company that's episode number 29 another person that both Steve Jobs studied extensively and his hero Edwin Land studied extensively was Alexander Graham Bell you will hear in these podcasts in these books Steve Jobs constantly refer and Edwin Land refers to the the the issues of creating something that's brand new that the world's never seen before just like Alexander Graham Bell did with the telephone they used a lot of his ideas with the marketing of in Edwin Land's case the the first instant camera that ever existed in the world and in Steve Jobs case the Macintosh he talks about this when he was in his 20s that's that's what blows my mind like he had this deep historical knowledge and he had the understanding how important it was Steve that is early on and I I did I read a biography of Evan Spiegel the founder of snapchat and I was shocked because when he's in his early 20s he's saying hey I want to build a company and I want to model it after my two heroes and he said his two heroes was Edwin Land and Steve Jobs and that's exactly what he's doing it's it's just again I just have to point this out to you because I didn't know before I started this project and I think most people don't know how much like how much of history's greatest entrepreneurs just straight up borrowed ideas built upon the ideas of the people that came before them they all do this and the fact that Evan Spiegel think about that now I think snapchat's worth I don't know let's say 30 billion dollars he might have a private net worth I don't know six billion or whatever it's a lot of money right it's how valuable to Evan was learning and studying Steve Jobs and Edwin Land well billions that's not hyperbolic that is a stone cold fact the fact that he learned from let them influence his the way his approach to his company was is literally worth billions of dollars and they all know this go back to Warren Buffett Charlie Munger there's a there's a great book on Charlie Munger called Poor Charlie Zominak there's a quote in that book that I've never forgot that's the number episode number 90 by the way I don't want to you know tell you every heavy podcast I've ever done you know that'd be hours and hours but in episode 90 I read Poor Charlie Zominak there's a quote in that book that I've never forgotten and what Charlie Munger has read hundreds of biographies he's a billionaire you know I don't think there's any billionaires that have not read a ton of biographies like it's crazy how much they all talk about Elon Musk that's where I got the idea to do this podcast I saw an interview with Elon Musk in 2012 and he was asked by this guy named Kevin Rose on this this this podcast used to exist called Foundation he's like you came from Kevin asked Elon he's like you came from South Africa then you went to Canada then you went to California you're in your 20s like how did you learn how to build companies like did you read a lot of business books and Elon said something that I never forgot and that's the initial idea to do this project to do this project he said no I didn't read business books I read biographies he's like I looked for mentors in historical context books basically I read biographies I thought they were helpful and he talks about reading by biography Benjamin Franklin Henry Ford Nikola Tesla obviously he's read biographies of every single person who's ever built a rocket like and he's still doing this to this day like how crazy like how many other people do you know that that are busier than Elon Musk for god's sake and this guy still takes time and spends time reading biographies what does that tell you this is clearly a high value activity that you need to make a part of your life so anyways Alexander Graham Bell 138 I don't know if I lost I went off on a tangent there number 138 reluctant genius the passion of life and inventive mind of Alexander Graham Bell I'm almost done this is Robert Friedland okay so Robert Friedland is the closest person I've ever covered that's like a cult leader and he was actually running this like commune when when Steve Jobs was in Steve Jobs and him were friends in college and people that knew Steve Jobs before he met Robert Friedland say that he wasn't very charismatic he met Robert Friedman who was extremely charismatic so Steve starts becoming more charismatic and understanding the influence that charisma can have on other humans around you right they went up having a falling out Steve Jobs says he like crosses the line between being like a charismatic founder and like a cult leader and like a con artist but Robert Friedland winds up becoming a billionaire I read this book number 131 the big score Robert Friedland and the voicey bay hustle and so Robert makes money in mining like selling mining rights and so Steve Jobs is in this book as well they talk about the relationship that Robert and Steve had they're not they were not they you know they used to be friends they never were after that but it was just a weird coincidence that two guys sitting in like an apple commune like this this communist like commune slash apple farm both hippies both dropping acid doing all this crazy stuff like both become billionaires one in technology building technology products and one in mining it was just very surprising and then the the last is Steve's best friend Steve did not have a lot of like close friends he dedicated his life to to work but his best friend was Larry Ellison I did a three-part series on Larry Ellison in all these books Steve Jobs is going to pull up is going to pop up rather because you know Larry talks about like he thinks Steve's one of the most important people to ever live like he just he almost like idolized him and Larry is a crazy character too like he's I mean just insane and he's been running his company since the 1970s you know he's worth tens and tens of billions of dollars this day but that's number 124 software an intimate portrait of Larry Ellison an article number 126 the billionaire and the mechanic that is a crazy book if you only read one book on Larry Ellison that that that's the book I would read the subtitle is how Larry Ellison and a car mechanic teamed up to win sailing's greatest race the American cup twice and finally number 127 the difference between God and Larry Ellison God doesn't think that he's Larry Ellison so that's it I'll list everything down below I hope I
