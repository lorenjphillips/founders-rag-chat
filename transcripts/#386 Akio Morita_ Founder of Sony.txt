Akio is a great example of this maxim that all of history's greatest founders studied history's greatest founders Phil Knight the founder of Nike studied Akio as did James Dyson as did Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos and a few months ago I was spending time with John Mackey who was the founder of Whole Foods John also Relentlessly studies the great founders that came before him and it was during one of our conversations that John told me one of the craziest Things that anyone has ever said about the podcast He had listened to over a hundred episodes before we met and he told me that if founders existed when he was young that Whole Foods would still be an independent company that since the podcast and all of history's greatest founders constantly emphasized the importance of controlling expenses That he would have actually put more of a priority on it, especially during good times during boom times I think it's very natural for a company and for human nature to just not watch your costs as closely because everything is going so well This is actually something that Andrew Carnegie noticed over 130 years ago Carnegie would repeat this mantra over and over again He said profits and prices are cyclical subject to any number of transient forces of the marketplace Costs however could be strictly controlled and any savings achieved in costs were permanent This is something I was talking about with my friend Eric who's the co-founder and CEO of ramp ramp is the presenting sponsor of this Podcast I've gotten to know all the co-founders ramp and I spent a ton of time with them They all listen to the podcast and they've picked up on the fact that the main theme from the podcast is on the importance Of watching your costs and controlling your spend and how doing so can give you a massive competitive advantage Akio said that this is something he did naturally that he was taught that wasting resources was a sin He starts Sony in a burned out department store in war-torn Tokyo They actually have to buy the materials they need to make their first products on the black market They had very little funding and so they were forced to watch every single penny That is a main theme for ramp the reason that ramp exists is to give you everything you need to control your spend Ramp gives you everything you need to control your cost ramp gives you easy to use corporate cards for your entire team Automated expense reporting and cost control. There is a line in Andrew Carnegie's biography that says cost control became nearly an obsession Sam Walton believed that this was fundamental to his success in building Walmart In fact in his autobiography Sam wrote our money was made by controlling expenses You can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation Or you can be brilliant and still go out of business if you're too inefficient Ramp helps you run an efficient organization make history's greatest founders proud by going to ramp.com Go to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today. That is ramp.com Forty years ago a small group gathered in a burned-out department store building in war devastated Tokyo Their purpose was to found a new company their optimistic goal was to develop the technologies that would help rebuild Japan's economy in this gathering was a young engineer a kiyomirita then just 25 years old Today that company is one of the most powerful and respected multinational corporations in the world Sony and a kiyomirita is its Outspoken founder that is an understatement The Sony story is one of consistently high quality merchandise and phenomenally successful marketing strategies Masterminded by marita who realized he would have to create the markets for Sony's unprecedented products marita striking departure from the traditional Japanese business practice of making decisions by committee led to the Spectacular success of Sony so that is an excerpt from the inside cover of the book that I want to talk to you about today Which is made in Japan a kiyomirita and Sony this book was published all the way back in 1986 and the re I did it I first read it I don't know probably five six years ago and made a podcast about it I think it's episode 102, but I recently went to Japan for the first time and Before the trip during the trip and then on the way home I was reading this book about the Japanese but a bunch of founders the Japanese electric Electronic industry founders from the 60s and 70s. The book is called we were burning and what is so fascinating is how many founders in that book talked about studying a kiyo and Sony and how that influenced them and gave them the confidence to start their own company 20 to 30 years later and that's actually how I first discovered a kiyo because I was reading about Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs and they would mention the influence that a kiyo and Sony had and you really use them as a model For their own company. So I just want to go through it's absolutely amazing How influential and how many other founders that have been in turn, you know influenced millions of other founders? And you can actually track a lot of their ideas back to a kiyo So this is something that Jeff Bezos said many many years ago and what he learned from a kiyo and how it influenced the building Amazon Bezos says right after World War two a kiyo marita the guy who founded Sony made the mission for Sony that they were gonna make Japan known for quality and you have to remember this was a time when Japan was known for cheap Copycat products and marita didn't say we're gonna make a Sony known for quality He said we're gonna make Japan known for quality He chose a mission for Sony that was bigger than Sony And so when we at Amazon talk about being Earth's most customer centric company, we have a similar idea in mind We want other companies to look at Amazon and see us as a standard bearer for obsessive focus on the customer as opposed to obsessive Focus on the competitor. Here's what James Dyson James Dyson wrote as his second autobiography when he was in his 70s And listen to what he said what he learned from studying a kiyo marita think of the Walkman So the Walkman is one of Sony's most successful products We'll talk a lot about that that came from a kiyo his own company tried to fight a kiyo and tell him no This is never going to work winds up selling like 400 million units one of the most successful consumer products of all time And so this is what James Dyson when he was studying a kiyo and Sony what he realized he was think of the Walkman His company didn't want to do the Walkman because it wouldn't record audio a kiyo marita brought out a tape recorder that didn't record It played music only his own company thought it was completely mad But that is brilliance that takes balls to say I'm going to bring out a product that doesn't do what people think it's going To do but it's going to enlighten their lives and then Phil Knight founder of Nike That's what he said like most companies we at Nike had role models Sony was one of them Sony was the apple of its day profitable innovative Efficient and it treated its workers well and so Steve Jobs Was actually the first person I learned about a kiyo marita from because he talked about Admiring the fact that they didn't do make me two products that they charge high prices But they were the best products in the world. He loved their marketing He in fact the same person, you know how Steve would wear that black turtleneck He visited Sony and met a kiyo when he was when Steve was early on and he loved the uniforms That all the Sony employees were war and so he asked the key like who designed these so wound up being I think the guys They just like Izzy Miyake or something like that And so Izzy's the one that designed Steve's black turtleneck that you know, he made famous He had like a hundred in his closet he'd wear every day But there is one funny story I read in a Steve Jobs story and then I'm gonna jump into a kill story It's unbelievable how Sony starts, you know after the the devastation Literally the lowest point in probably Japanese history right after the atomic bomb is dropped and the war ends But Steve Jobs when he was building the iMac he was coming up with a name. He didn't have a name And so he was walking around. He's like, you know, we're gonna call it Mac man because he was so inspired by a kiyo's Product walk Walkman and so everybody around Steve was like this is a terrible idea Please don't do this And so eventually, you know, he corrected course on that and and picked iMac which again is a much more elegant and better name But I just thought it was really fascinating So I want to start is very fascinating where the book is published in the t6 40 years after World War two and yet where it is a kiyo choose to start his life story to tell his autobiography at this time I think he's his late 60s when he were hanging when he writes this book and he decides to start it with his Response to hearing about the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima and at the time he's in the Navy He had already graduated with a physics degree and we're gonna see a couple things here. This can jump out That's really important that are tied directly to the success of Sony in my opinion is the fact that a kiyo had Immense from a young age immense self-confidence So he says I was having lunch with my Navy colleagues when the incredible news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima arrived as a Technical officer just at a college with a degree in physics I understood what the bomb was and what it meant to Japan and to me the future had never been more uncertain Okay, so imagine if you were in his shoes here in your early 20s You have an understanding because you have a physics degree What just happened the fact that Japan has never up until this point lost a war most people would be terrified Listen to his response and only a young man could be optimistic yet I had confidence in myself and in my future even then If you have not listened to the Michael Dell episode I did last week, please listen to it It might be one of the best episodes that I ever made it I think it's gonna be most popular episode ever made there's something in Michael Dell's story everybody knows, you know the the brand name they didn't understand the story that's really resonating with people and One of my favorite things that Michael Dell said at 19 years old, you know, Akio is not much older here, right saying I don't know why I was optimistic at the time when you know complete devastations around me We'll get into the details of just the environment that he's building Sony and it's unbelievable And yet I had confidence in myself and in my future even then and so what did Michael Dell say, you know We need to teach Having this argument his dad like what do you want to do with your life? It's like I want to compete with IBM from my dorm room with a thousand dollars and Michael Dell said was I little full Of myself at 19 sure I was I think you have to be to do anything important Let's go back to Akio when I first heard of the atomic attack on Hiroshima It struck me that American industrial might was even greater than we realized it was simply overwhelming I should have been prepared for it I had seen a film on the construction of the Ford Motor Company River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan now, it's gonna sound crazy to Americans today But at the time Ford actually built it was the world's largest integrated factory at the time We spread across 2,000 acres and the facility was able to produce Firstly every component for for a car from raw materials to final assembly and so when he's I think he was in high school when he was watching videos on What they were able to create an industrial might that America had back then and This is the realization that Akio had it that kind of terrified him. Japan had no integrated manufacturing like that at the time I had seen the terrible results of conventional fire bombing even before the atomic bomb I was in Tokyo when the incendiary bombs whipped up a firestorm. They killed 100,000 people in a few hours all of Japan's major industrial cities had been charred wastelands This is where this is again. This is a year the year after this is when he's gonna start Sony in 1945 you would see depressing heaps of blackened remains that were blackened remains were the homes of literally millions of Japanese and then yet again, he's gonna hit us very surprising When you read this book one, he's like he's got a huge personality. He really likes to talk I don't there's another way he says he likes to talk a lot of shit and it's really fun To read and he'll give you opinions on all kinds of stuff Like how he raises his kids to the hollowing out of American industry to the difference between the what the Japanese do Right what they do bad. He'll travel all over the world and meet, you know, the Chinese and the Russians is like you're doing it wrong He's just very funny guy But he also it's also surprising because as you're reading he's talking about this and you're like just imagine, you know You shouldn't just read through these books quickly try to sit there and put yourself in that position Imagine me 24 imagine, you know living your whole life in Japan and you just see this hundred thousand people die in a few hours There's no end. The industry is completely wiped out millions of homes are gone And yet he says I don't mind saying that even then I felt somehow I had a role to play in the future of Japan I didn't know how big a role it was going to turn out to be so and he goes back in life All right goes back in time. Okay So at that point young person in the Navy Physicist degree knows he wants to play a role in rebuilding Japan thinks he's the right person right so skills at the right time Okay Then he tells us about his childhood. So Akio is from an extremely wealthy family He had his family had a 300 year old family business They created and brewed sake and other alcohol. He was supposed to be the 15th generation heir to the family fortune Okay, there's a lesson about about focus in here I was born the first son in the 15th generation heir to one of Japan's finest and oldest sake brewing families The marita family had been making sake for 300 years Now here's the problem. They were very prosperous There's gonna be two generations above his father that almost caused the family to go into bankruptcy And this is the lesson about focus his dad's gonna end up saving the company Unfortunately, the taste of a couple generations of marita family heads was so refined They spent all their time collecting art and antiques as a result the business suffered because they pursued their artistic Interest and decided to put the family business in other hands They relied on hired outside managers to run the marita company But to these managers the business was no more than a livelihood And if the business did not do well that was to be regretted but it was not crucial to their personal survival So I love this idea, you know, I've talked to you about this over and over again I think it's really important to reread books reread books that are really important to you because the words on the page don't change But you have changed like think about all the stuff I have read and learned and you've done that You've come along with me on this crazy ride, you know in the last five years since the time I last read this book and now because I just spent you know Two weeks studying Michael Dell and reading both the books that he wrote There's a lot of Dell that jumps out to me There's a lot of similarities in between a Kio and Dell in this in the sense He's like well here for 15 for 13 14 generations up until this point The marita family business was run by somebody in the marita family Obviously gonna care about it has your your name your aunt your family's tied to it I think about when Dell was having all these problems and he wanted he was trying to take the company private back in 2012 2013 was a real big struggle. He kind of lost control of the company with his name on it and they're like I don't get it You're already rich. Why do you care? Like why don't you just go you know on the beach in Hawaii or if you don't want to do that start another company and Dell says something was excellent. He's just like I don't want to start another company. This company is my name on it I'm gonna care about this company after I'm dead I think there's a lot of similarities that when you when you look at these these multi-generational family businesses, especially The marita is like the other ones I've studied They teach you so that from the time their kids are really young about the ancestors and the decisions they made and how they built The businesses, you know 50 hundred years before you even alive So they messed up by essentially outsourced outsourcing the management and then they're like, hey, we're rich Let's just go buy art and antiques and do all this other stuff that has nothing to do with the business and So said they did not carry the responsibility of the generations and that's exactly how it's framed for for Akio and his father And so that is when the business fell into my father's hands as the first son of the family He was faced with the immediate task of bringing the company back to profitability and restoring the marita family fortunes No outside manager could be counted on to do that for him So when Akio's dad inherits the business and it's his turn to take over the business on brink of bankruptcy Okay Now his dad does turn around the business so by the time that Akio is born The family's wealthy again and he talked about this openly he says I'd never had to know probation as a child We were a rich family and when he means rich family means like huge house, which is very rare in Japan our own tennis courts We had staff we had butlers we had chauffeurs We lived in the best neighborhood with the other wealthy Japanese families And in fact, they're the rich the richest family in Japan at the time was to Toyota's they lived like across the street and his Parents would prepare him from a young kid a young child to say hey you're going to you're enjoying that the you know, the fruits of the labor of and the compounding of past generations and When your father can no longer do it you're expected to take over as the first son my father and my mother father were grooming me To carry on as the heir to the family business I was taught about my ancestors from early childhood so they would teach him about the business decisions of previous generations and This is that what he would take away from studying his ancestors Tenacity perseverance and optimism are traits that have been handed down to me through my family genes My father was determined to give me a business education starting very early. He was a warm and generous father He spent all of his leisure time with his children. I have many fond memories of my father So from an early age Akio is going to with his dad They go to the family office. They go to the breweries by the time Akio is 10 or 11 years old He is actually sitting in on board meetings of the family business Now he loves his family. He's fascinated in business, but he that wasn't his obsession He finds his obsession his obsession very similar to Michael Dell is the fact that he's obsessed with electronics There's all these like hobbyist and amateur ways to create their own homemade electronics for the very essentially the first time in history at least in in In the Kios life and so one of Akio's relatives was this amateur engineer and he built his own electric phonograph So, you know so a way to to play back recorder music He just couldn't believe that his he was able to like take these parts buy these parts and then learn how to do this Basically himself and like to make amateur Electronic devices that he could use and so making radios was actually becoming like little ham radios was becoming a very popular Hobby in Japan So he says I began to buy books about electronics and I subscribe to all the magazines that contain all the latest information about sound Reproduction in radio this exactly what Michael Dell did for computers and that would be about 40 years later than when Akio's doing it in Japan for essentially radio soon I was spending so much time on electronics that was hurting my schoolwork I was devoting near you all my after-school hours to my new hobby I had to teach myself because the subjects I was really interested in were not taught in school in those days I became so engrossed in my electronic tinkering. They almost flunked out of school So by the time he graduated high school His dad expects him you're gonna go to college and you're gonna study business You're gonna study economics and Akio's like no even hey, I think it's already obvious He's unmanageable You're not gonna be able to tell this guy to do anything that he doesn't want to do And so he'd already started studying physics in high school and he just completely fell in love with it And so he says this is also the age when he realizes that he has higher levels of determination than most other people I don't think there's a Kindle version of the book or else I would have bought it just to search to find out how many times the word, you know, determined I'm determined or the phrase I'm determined or determination is Is said repeats it over and over again from a young age till all the way up until you know, he's building Sony It's constantly repeating. I'm determined. I'm determined. I was very determined So my father was disappointed that did not choose to study economics. He expected me to assume my role in the family business He believed that physics would eventually only be a hobby But Akio said that he wanted to study physics because he wanted to know why things worked So he had an obsession with physics. He had obsession with electronics after He graduates with his physics degree. He goes into college, but he never stops tinkering this tinkering that started from when he was a young young Boy, he's doing it to a high school. He's doing that to college. He's still doing in the Navy He said I had built an alarm clock He's still tinkering which was attached to my radio and was set to wake me up every morning at 6 a.m I remember very clearly the morning when my alarm clock turned on my radio and I heard the announcement that Japanese forces had attacked Pearl Harbor. I was shocked. I remember thinking that this was a dangerous thing I had grown up believing the West was somehow superior in technology knowing about America's technology I was concerned that a mistake had been made remember This is all connected the fact that he grew up in a wealthy family mean that it meant they could afford Western goods almost they had a Ford car their dad was was yearning around in a chauffeur by chauffeur in a Buick They had a general elect products from General Electric from Westinghouse. They admired the tech at least inside his family They admired American ingenuity and technology so now he's like oh shit. We're in big trouble We just bombed the country that seems to be superior to us in technology knowing about America's technology was concerned that a mistake had been made so Beginning the war because he's in the Navy there this actually inadvertently is going to lead him to meeting his eventual co-founder this genius Engineer who's 13 years older than a Kiosk and him a buka Kiosk is assigned because of his physics background there He's this on the special group project that's composed of researchers from the army Navy and civilian sector and such they're trying to figure out how to to create heat-seeking missiles and One of the civilians in the group was this brilliant electronic engineer and at the time He already also had his own company, which is very fascinating to a Kio. His name is Masuro a buka So he's talking about the fact that he's got this he's in a group with his bees other genius engineers from the army from the Navy And the civilian sector one of them obviously being a buka and he was young and he says I was a merely a recent university Graduate, but I was cocky this goes back to this He does not hide the fact that he thought you know He was special from birth that he has a role to play and that you know He could keep up with the very best and this goes the reason I keep hammering this is because one it takes a cocky Person in my opinion or very self-governing person to start a business in a burned-out department store All right They literally would have to have umbrellas at their desks because when it rained the water would fall onto their desks Okay, you have no resources when you're doing that and then it's not like she's like Oh, we're just gonna like mass produce a bunch of cheap copycat products We aimed for the high end right from the get-go in fact while I was Working on the outline for this episode in the background one of my favorite documentaries of all time that I've watched I don't even know how many times maybe 10 20 times by now is the defiant ones about Jimmy I've eaten dr Dre M&M it's it's a fascinating documentary that HBO put out four-part documentary I watched it over and over again all kinds of fascinating people in there Bruce Springsteen Tom Petty But that kind of personality type that defiant one It made me think as I'm as I'm reading Akio the same thing that the same time is playing in the background Oh, he is a defiant one The way I would define is like that's the same kind of person who think they can build a great company from the ashes Literally, they can build a great company from the ashes ashes. So it becomes obvious by this point that Japan is not gonna win the war and there's talks that the Navy might order us to commit mass suicide and Akio goes and tells his commanding officer that he will not obey that order And he says an officer in the Navy should never have said such a thing to his superior But it just had to say it and what was really like it talks about this intense Ideology that they had that that Akio thought was ridiculous the commanding officer like yells at him He's like, well, you know You're gonna be court-martial and you'll be punished if you don't do it and Akio's thought was you guys are all gonna commit mass suicide Who's gonna be left to punish me? It was like an obvious thing like that's obviously not true. So the war ends. This is when the Americans are gonna occupy Japan and This is remarkable. Like you know the Japanese Emperor they had never spoken directly to his people This is the very first time they actually ever hear his voice in fact Akio talks about that he would travel around the country and If like his motorcade passed by you were expected as a citizen. You couldn't even look at him You're not allowed to look at him. You're supposed to turn and like hide your and direct your gaze elsewhere Again, something that Akio just would not do But I think the advice that the Emperor gives to the Japanese people after the war is actually really it applies to any difficult challenge So says the Emperor who up and now had never been spoke had never spoken directly to his people Told us that told us the immediate future would be grim He said that we could pave the way for grand peace for all generations to come But we had to do it by enduring the unendurable and suffering what is insufferable He urged Japan to look ahead unite your total strength to be devoted to the construction for the future and he challenged the nation to keep pace with the progress of the world, so Unite your total strength to be devoted to the construction of the future and keep pace with the progress of the world That's exactly what Akio is gonna do with Sony. That's really what jumped out to me now one of my favorite quotes I think Charlie Munger is the wisest person I've ever come across one of my favorite things that he ever said was that you need To avoid intense ideology because it turns your brain to cabbage it turns your brain to cabbage And so Akio says that his family Avoided this likely they were surrounded by people by fanaticism and by you know People saying like we should go down to the last man like we'd rather Extinguish the country of Japan and lose a war So says our family had avoided the fanaticism that seemed to grip so much of Japan's youth in those days The worship of the Emperor and the idea of a glorious death in Japan we often talk of a Psychological climate or atmosphere that sometimes occurs and which seems to sweep people up into like-minded activity as Though everybody is breathing the same special kind of air now. He's saying that happens in Japan We know that happens everywhere. He's just to be very careful avoid a tense ideology. It turns your brain into cabbage Now this is one of the most inspiring parts of the entire book if you think about The conditions in Japan right before Akio founds Sony many cities looked as though there was nothing more to bomb Flimsy houses shops and factories made of wood and paper had burned like dry tinder Under a shower of fire bombs in Tokyo less than half of the pre-war population of 7 million people Remained into the city only 10% of the city's street cars were running There was 60 buses in running condition and just a handful of automobiles and trucks in the entire city Hospitals were short of everything Department store shelves were empty and there's also Almost no food. In fact when they decide hey, we're gonna start a new company and his co-founder book is the first the person That says start the company first They're like why you met why are you trying to make electronics you should try to make food because food was so scarce It's so crazy. So Akio Talks about his future co-founder and this is something that you and I talked about over and over again You must you must absolutely must find and work find the best people you possibly can and work with them and Akio realized like oh it's very similar to like Steve Jobs realizing Wozniak He said something like Wozniak had like more talent on like 50 You could be like 50 average engineers and Wozniak would outperform all of them There's an element of that with Akio just thinks that his co-founder, you know The most brilliant engineer alive and he was already a buka was already running a company out in like the countryside It was the Japan measuring instrument company He's gonna quit doing this and move to Tokyo to start what's eventually gonna turn to Sony But Akio tells a great stories about a buka and he just talks about this guy's mind is like any unlike anybody else's So he's he's he gives an example to us here. He's like, okay. Well there you know, he has like 1,500 employees already They're making the small mechanical elements that control the frequency of radar devices these devices have to oscillate at exactly 1,000 cycles per second and Abouka had the ingenious idea of hiring music students who had a fine sense of pitch to check the accuracy of the elements Against a simple 1000 cycle tuning fork I mentioned this story as an example of the freshness and inventiveness of his mind Which so impressed me and made me want to work with this man And so the prehistory of Sony is a buka is gonna make some very smart decisions first He's gonna move to Tokyo Second he works on what interests him and then third the very first product He finds a way to add features to a product that a lot of people already have You know there one thing that is very obvious in the book is like when you they're forced to design with constraints They are forced on a company level on an individual level a company level and a country level to be resourceful And I think the idea of let's say hey, there's already a product that's out there Can we add features to this kind of jump starts, you know our distribution? And so it says Abouka had a very intriguing idea since shortwave receivers These are these are little radios of everybody had in during the war because they would broadcast like updates in the war Okay, so one is just like you they're not expensive and they're essentially ubiquitous in Japan Shortwave receivers were strictly prohibited during the war a keen interest had developed in listening to shortwave Broadcasts now that it was no longer illegal. Okay, so you had this like black market underground everybody had him anyways But now it's not illegal so now we can actually start making products for this so that the install base is already there, right? Because the radio was very important for hearing air raid warnings and getting other information during the war people had taken very good Care of their radios, but they could only receive regular AM broadcasts So Abouka designed a shortwave adapter Something that could be attached to any standard radio very simply and would convert the unit to a shortwave reception The conditions in which he did this is incredible. There's almost no Inventory anyway, so you have to scripted employees that Abouka had a time would literally have to buy They have to go to the black market to buy the tubes that they need to make this Adapter the shortwave adapter they start making them the product immediately comes very very popular So they are doing this in Tokyo in an empty and bare old building Set among the rubble and devastation the burned out homes and shops of the once prosperous downtown area of Tokyo Abouka started the Tokyo telecommunications research Laboratories, this is the company that's going to turn into Sony and Akio does not hide the fact that without Abouka there would be no Sony So what Akio does it's really smart and I think in line with his personality and who he was as a person he senses an Opportunity he does not wait. He jumps on it immediately So he wrote to Abouka he writes him a letter So that I want to help him with his new business and was support him any way I could he wrote back immediately Inviting me to come see him and a new company But he told me that things were pretty tight and then he was paying people out of his own pocket and he was looking For funding I need to back up and tell you one thing What Akio was doing at this time his old physics professor at University there was a drastic and dire need for Physics instruction and so Akio his job right now why he figures out what to do is he's teaching physics to the university So he's like, hey, don't worry. You have trouble meeting me meeting your payroll I can I'm gonna work I'm gonna teach during the day and work with you and then I could just live on my salary from my teaching job now what they go and do this is very common like Japanese culture is They go they they have to ask his dad Abouka and Akio go and talk to Akio's dad, right? Because Abouka they he realizes how valuable Akio is gonna be for the company They're gonna want to be in co-founders for this They have to get essentially get permission from his father. Abouka told my father about the new venture Now this is very fascinating and this is again talks about Remember Akio mentioned earlier. I have great memories of my father. His father's long since passed away by the time He's writing his book. I have great memories of my father. He was a great father his job. Seriously He made our family wealthy again and then when he wasn't working was spending time with us and we just had great memories and I think one of the most important things is his father knew his son His father knew his son and this would make sense in one second Abouka told my father about the new venture what they hope to accomplish and then I was absolutely needed for the new business His father said tells Abouka I expect him to succeed me as head of the family and take over the family business Kiyo sitting in on this meeting. Okay But if my son wants to do something else he should do it he looked at me and smiled You're gonna do what you like best He knew his son. He knew his son. That's one of the best things that he could have ever done for a son So this is the early and he's gonna do they're gonna wind up helping because they go to his dad Akio's dad for loans They wind up couldn't he winds up loaning of money. They convert that money into Into equity and then his dad's gonna make a lot of money on the Sony stock This is very fascinating the early days of Sony no money Work workspace and an old bombed out building and a company of misfits That I don't know why this like it brings like tears to my eyes. It's just funny. This this section This section is gonna be funny. So our new company was not sending any records for financial success in those days Yeah, no shit when some of my relatives came to see me memory. I was from rich family Okay, when some of my relatives come to see me They were so shocked by the shabby conditions that they thought I had become an anarchist They could not understand how if I was not a radical I could choose to work in a place like that I don't know why that makes me laugh now This is what I mean about self-confidence this is what I mean about I kind of knew who they were from a young age and what they wanted to do and They knew from the beginning we're gonna build differentiated products They wanted to be high quality innovators Really when you get to the section of the book the personality type we're dealing with here You think of Steve Jobs at Apple think of Edwin Land at Polaroid Edwin Land's personal motto for God's sake was don't do anything Somebody else can do I don't even know if they ever explicitly say this but when when you have somebody saying hey I'm gonna do something completely differentiated. I'm gonna do a better anybody else in the world There is an element of pride and self-respect and competitive drive To what they're saying that is implied in what they're saying and even if they don't say their actions express What's important to them they want to do something truly unique they want to do something truly special Which Sony may not be like that today, but undoubtedly for four the first four decades. It was that it was its leader It was completely innovative So it says Ibuka and I often spoke of the concept of our new company as an innovator a clever company that would make new High technology products in ingenious ways Merely building radios was not our idea of the way to fulfill these ideas. And so that's the important part You might not be able to get there from from the very beginning so they're essentially building radios They're adding it they have this little adapter that goes on to other things that an existing product But you have to get started somehow and I think that's really important It's like this is we know where we're going But we're gonna do the best with the opportunities in front of us is how I read this part of the book now Another thing always do your best work even terrible working conditions We talked about this over and over again you and I talked about this over again that opportunity handled Well will unlock leads to unexpected opportunities so the Americans they need they're they're putting out You know, they're coming to Japan. They're essentially controlling everything for the time being they they're starting to put out all like requests for things that they need built and the occupation American forces Had taken over the Japanese Broadcasting company and they need this new technical equipment. They need mixing units and other studio and broadcasting equipment Okay, Buka knows how to build all this he had previous experience with this So they submit a bid on a contract to do this for the Americans So they're gonna get a bid to build this mixing unit. Okay. Now there's something really funny that happens the general has to go and actually tour your factory or your offices and They're like what the hell is going on here They tore it after they awarded them the bed just as when the general saw our shop He was taken aback by how primitive was he shook his head. We were this tiny unknown company working in very primitive conditions He was concerned about our terrible building He was so concerned about a terrible building that he recommended we keep buckets of sand and water around the place in case it caught fire When the equipment was delivered everyone marveled at its quality Especially the skeptical officer who was still puzzled by the fact that a new small company in a makeshift factory could produce such a high technology product We were able to obtain further jobs because of the breakthrough and trust we made on that first job by Demonstrating our quality and even more important when they deliver this mixing unit to the Americans They spot a tape recorder for the very first time and they immediately realize it's obvious like wait tape recorders are that superior? Technology to a wire recorder So they decide to build the side to build when they decided to build a tape recorder that in turn leads to another important insight That they're gonna build their entire company run so one of the things that that Steve Jobs admired so much about Sony was their marking how impressive their marking was and that was a skill they had to learn because both the key and a book Abouka our engineers they're like, oh we build a great product customers will come and obviously it's not true They build the best tape recorder, but the tape recorder flops And so this is when they learn a very important lesson You must know and then find your target customer and Akio is going to become obsessed with marketing and advertising So I had no experience in merchandising or salesmanship It never occurred to a book or me that there was any need for this Abouka believed strongly that all we had to do was make good products and orders would come so did I we both had a Lesson to learn we were engineers and we had big dreams of success. We thought in making a unique product We would surely make a fortune I then realized that having unique technology and being able to make unique products were not enough to keep a business going You have to learn to sell the products and to do that You have to show the potential buyer the real value of what you're selling I was struck with the realization that I was going to have to be the merchandiser of our small company And so at the beginning they try to sell the tape recorder just like normal people Like they'll do demonstrations on the street and everything and people like oh, that's kind of cool But you know, it's kind of a toy and it's really expensive Like I'm not sure why I'd buy that definitely not gonna spend that much money on it And he realized like oh I need to find people that have a problem to solve and then they'll understand The value immediately he says I knew that to sell our recorder We'd have to identify the people and institutions that would be likely to recognize the value in our product It wouldn't be a toy for them. It'd be a tool. There was an acute shortage of Stenographers because so many people have been pushed out of school and into war work Until that shortage could be corrected the courts of Japan were trying to cope with a small overworked core of courts tonographers And so what they realized is the tape recorder would be very effective For to record all this instead of having somebody who needs to type it right away, right? We were able to demonstrate our machine for the Japan Japanese Supreme Court and we sold 20 machines instantly Those people had no difficulty realizing how they could put our device to practical use They saw the value in the tape recorder Immediately and so one thing that was very consistent with Akio and a buga was the fact that they were always on the lookout for Developments of new technology made by other people and how they could take advantage of that so they followed the work of Bell Labs, for example very closely and When the transistor was invented they realized oh this is gonna help us make a lot of these devices that are exist and we can actually make them smaller and they thought they had an advantage because Miniaturization and compactness was something that was very important to Japanese culture And so Akio is gonna have this idea for what he calls a pocket radio You can almost see this almost like a precursor to the Walkman and then in turn is the precursor to you know Steve Jobs on the iPod The idea you can have a thousand songs in your pocket is what obviously Steve said in their case It's like you have a radio that fits in your shirt pocket and you see this You know, he's a very quick learner this this showmanship and marketing genius that Akio starts to develop We can make a very small radio powered by batteries Miniaturization and compactness have always appealed to the Japanese our boxes have been made to nest our fans fold our art rolls into neat scrolls We set as our goal a radio small enough to fit into a shirt pocket not just portable I said but pocketable now We like the idea of an a salesman being able to demonstrate how simple would be to drop it into a shirt pocket problem is The the product they make was slightly bigger than a standard men's shirt pocket and that gave us a Gave us a problem. So what do you do when your pocket size radio? Doesn't fit in a pocket you make the pocket bigger. Of course, we came up with a simple solution We had some shirts made for our salesmen with slightly larger than normal pockets Just big enough to slip the radio into now You're something in this also story that I think is really important for people to understand Products don't compete companies do products don't compete companies do so There's an American company called Regency that put out a pocket radio a few months before ours But the company gave up without putting much effort into marketing it So I can't I can't understate or overstate rather How important advertising promotion and set and and and educating the market is for these new products to Akio is he will literally threaten To fire people if they're if they don't listen to him if they're not spending the budgets He wants to spend when he launches new products And so this idea is like he has the kind of disdain for other companies that don't put much effort into marketing And so this this American company called Regency, okay They had the radio they had the market to themselves for a few months the company gave up without putting much effort into marketing it as The first in the field they might have capitalized on their position and created a tremendous market for their product as we did But they apparently judged mistakenly there was no future in the business and gave it up So a few years into Sony they're starting to get traction There's developing the ability to not only create new products, but also market them and Akio decides hey, I'm gonna go all over the world and I'm gonna visit other companies and factories and I want to learn from them And I want to pull out one thing that he found really really inspiring Which is at the time one of the most successful companies in the world was Phillips It was my first visit to Phillips that gave me a new insight It was a surprise to me to find the great Phillips of my imagination Situated in a small town in a small corner of a small agricultural country I was taken with the thought that a man born that's dr. Phillips I was taken with the thought that a man born in such a small out-of-the-way place could build such a huge highly technical company With a fine worldwide reputation Maybe I thought we could do the same in Japan So now he starts understanding the why behind Sony We're gonna change the image of Japanese products as at the time they were thought of poor quality Exactly what Jeff Bezos said earlier They were copycats of low quality In fact, one of the soundest things in the early days of Sony The reputation of poor quality for Japanese products was so well known that in the early days Sony would print Made in Japan as small as possible on its products Said sometimes it was so small you couldn't even read what it was And so another thing that Akio realizes that's really smart is If I want to make products known for quality I need to target an affluent audience that can actually afford to pay for quality And so he says the Japanese company must export goods in order to survive It became obvious to me that if we did not set our sights on marketing abroad We would not grow to be the kind of company that Buka and I had envisioned We wanted to change the image of Japanese goods as poor in quality And if you're going to sell high quality expensive product You need an affluent market And that means a rich sophisticated country And I'm gonna get to this in a little bit But Akio takes a very drastic measure When he realizes, oh, America is so important to the future of our company That I'm going to move at the drop of a dime my entire family there I have to be able to sell to Americans I have to understand them So therefore I have to live like an American This guy is incredible I'll get there in a minute I want to go back to this because he talks about something over and over again Marketing is just communication So you have to be able to communicate directly He does not like intermediaries He doesn't want anybody in between him and his end customer He talks about why this is so important He talks about the importance of laying the groundwork Of very slowly educating the market before you release the product There's a lot of great ideas in here that I think are timeless Marketing is really just a form of communication In the traditional Japanese system for distributing consumer products The manufacturers are kept at arms length from the consumer Direct communication with the consumer is all but impossible That is not good enough for Akio We realized from the beginning that it would not serve the needs of our company And its new advanced technology products Okay, so they're gonna set up their own stores They're gonna go direct to the consumer If we're separated by a third or a fourth party They simply would not have the same interest in our enthusiasm for our products and our ideas that we had It's gonna sound exactly like the reason If you think about the rationale that Akio is demonstrating We're probably in the late 1950s, early 1960s It sounds exactly like if you go back and read Steve Jobs thinking when he wanted to do the Apple stores Exactly, it's the same kind of thinking They arrive at the same exact conclusion It's like, wait a minute, so other people are gonna sell the products We gave our heart, our soul, our blood, our sweat, our tears, all of our life energy and our time to develop our products And we're gonna hand them off to people that don't give a shit? No, not good enough Not gonna happen We had to educate our customers to the uses of our products To do so, we had to set up our own outlets and establish our own ways of getting goods into the market And he's got some great ideas about that, which we'll get to in a minute Now, one thing that's really, really important Again, it's gonna sound a lot like Steve Jobs It's gonna sound a lot like Edwin Land It's gonna sound a lot like James Dyson No market research The public does not know what is possible We do I mean, think about the Walkman That market was just sitting there Somebody could have grabbed it And everybody's saying it was a shitty idea to begin with And you're just gonna sell 400 million units It's incredible So the reason that's also beneficial That you don't have to wait on the market research What if the market doesn't exist? What is there to research? He trusts in his own judgment, his taste, and the skill set that he has And what would happen is None of his competitors They were like kind of copycats and follow-ons So he winds up creating the market And then having the market to himself for a very long time Our competitors would take a very cautious wait and see attitude While we market and develop a new product In the early days, we would often have that market to ourselves For a year or more before other companies Would be convinced that the product would be a success And we made a lot of money Having the market all to ourselves We have to keep a premium on innovation This is something that him and Abouka talked about from day one Our plan is to lead the public with new products Rather than ask them what kind of products they want The public does not know what is possible, but we do So instead of doing market research We refine our thinking on a product And its use And try to create a market for it by educating and communicating with it Communicating with the public Do you see how everything he says is interacted? We're going to aim straight for the top We're going to innovate We're going to have high prices We're going to have big margins We're going to be the best marketers We're going to educate the customer We're going to go direct Everything works together As an example, I cite a product surely everyone knows of The Walkman This idea took shape when Abouka came to my office one day With one of our portable stereotype recorders Okay? So he's carrying around this like heavy thing Which sounds funny now Remember people who would put like boom boxes on their shoulders and stuff? You'd see movies like in New York City, you know, back in the 80s I bring that up because it was obvious Like what is that person doing? That person is carrying something It's like 15 pounds He's carrying around with him Because he wants his music to travel with him Everybody was listening to music at their homes, in their bedrooms You're taking these giant 15 or 20 pounds stairs around with you What does that tell you? There's clearly a demand here Just no one has done it yet That seems kind of odd, right? So he's got his own co-founder One of the genius engineers The person that invents the products And this guy has like some, you know, half-baked solution to this problem I got this big-ass tape recorder I can record things I can play things And then we have these big-ass headphones And you know, this is the way I take around my music On its face, that makes no sense Clearly, like there's a demand here, right? So he says he looked unhappy And complained about the weight of the system I asked him what was on his mind He explained, I like to listen to music But I don't want to disturb others And then I can't sit there by my stereo all day, right? Because it's not portable So this is my solution I take the music with me But it's too heavy Abucas complaint set me into motion I ordered our engineers to take one of our reliable small cassette tape recorders And strip, this is the important part Where people thought no one would want it Strip out the recording circuit I'm not recording anything We're not going to record anything on it Because the recording circuit makes it bigger I need to make it smaller This is just very logical, clear thinking And then take out the speaker Because you're going to do this with headphones So now I just took out the recording unit And took out the speaker What happened? I just made it miniaturized Which means you could carry it Replace them, the recording circuit and the speaker With very lightweight headphones Which they also had to invent Okay? Now here's the crazy thing Everybody gave me a hard time It seemed as though nobody liked the idea Will people buy it if it doesn't have recording capability? I don't think so That's the pushback that he's getting Of course they will They're already finding these half-baked solutions to the problem They just want to take their music with them This is really, really smart on what he did here He goes, this is his response Millions of people have bought car stereos And they don't have recording capabilities I already told you They're not recording anything in the car Millions of people bought this Isn't that a little weird? So you tell me they would only do this if they're in the car? No, of course not They would take it with them And I think millions will buy this machine Now he gets the prototype back I thought we had produced a terrific item And I was full of enthusiasm for it But our marketing people were unenthusiastic Think about how many people are just telling him over and over again This is not going to sell But I was so confident This is why I kept mentioning his self-confidence And the fact that he called himself cocky These are his words, not mine This is why it's so important It jumped out at you over and over again if you read this book And it's why I kept bringing it up to you What did Nolan Bushnell, who mentored Steve Jobs Who helped shape Steve Jobs' thinking He hired Steve Jobs when he was 19 What did he say? He says only the arrogant are self-confident enough to push their ideas onto other people What did Edwin Land say? That when you create a new product People think, oh, I've got to push it through staunch opposition He's like, no, it's going to be staunch indifference No one's going to give a shit You have to push You have to be the one pushing through Your new product, your new invention Do indifference You have to make people care about them Every single step of the way From his engineers to his marketing people To asking people around Like, this is stupid, no one's going to buy it This is why it's so important He says so But I was so confident that the product was viable That I said I would take personal responsibility for the project He used his unusual levels of self-confidence To push past all the naysayers in his own company I never had a reason to regret it The idea took hold And from the very beginning The Walkman was a runaway success My point in telling the story is simple I do not believe that any amount of market research Could have told us that the Sony Walkman would be successful Another lesson from Akio and his autobiography Is that if you know why you are doing what you are doing Hard decisions become a lot easier So he says, I turned down a chance to make big profits The buyers thought I was crazy But even though our company was young and I was inexperienced Time has shown that I made the right decision So he's going and he's demoing this product This is one of these radios That the early days of Sony that they're making And it's this giant company called Belova He says the people at Belova liked the radio so much That their purchasing officer said We definitely want these We'll take 100,000 units 100,000 units, I was stunned It was an incredible order With several times the total capital of our company He told me there's one condition We have to put the Belova name on the radios So Yankoff your Sony name You're going to manufacture and make it But you're going to put our name on the product That stopped me I had vowed that we would not be an original equipment maker For other companies We wanted to make a name for our company On the strength of our own products We would not produce radios under another brand name When I would not budge, he got short with me Our company name is a famous brand name And it's taken over 50 years to establish No one has ever even heard of your brand name No one has ever even heard of your company Why not take advantage of ours? I understood what he was saying But I had my own view I said 50 years ago your brand name Was just as unknown as our name is today I am here with a new product And I am now taking the first step For the next 50 years of my company 50 years from now I promise you That our name will be just as famous As your company name is today He never even considered it One of my favorite episodes ever done I found this really old biography of Ralph Lauren And one thing that's that I think the reason I wanted to read about Ralph Because I watched a documentary one time And same thing He had no money He's living in this studio apartment With the train running over him They just have a mattress on the floor It's him and his wife Who he's still married to to this day He starts out making ties That's the very beginning of the Ralph Lauren empire And he goes and meets I think Bloomingdale's If I remember correctly Bloomingdale's are incredible I've never seen any designs like this We'll have this big giant order This guy has no money at the time So it's literally a life saving amount of money And then they're like great Love to do this Oh by the way Ralph Lauren Take that off and put on our house brand And Ralph says no Even when he had no money And he's like I'm not being an original equipment maker For other companies I'm here to take the steps To build a lasting and enduring brand And it takes a lot of courage to do that Anyways Akio just turned down an order for 100,000 units Which was worth several times The total capital of his company But again if you know the why Your why just makes The why behind what you're doing Just makes all these decisions easier to make They're difficult at the time But understanding is like hey This is where we're going And we're not going to deviate from that Another thing that's from the very beginning We're going to be the best We're going to aim straight for the top This is something they talk about over and over again We were not interested in producing Low quality goods just to make money What I had in mind was class and high quality Later on he talks about You know we wanted to be Sony We viewed Sony as a pioneer Sony is a pioneer It never intends to follow others The company will always be a seeker of the unknown That is a great line The company will always be a seeker of the unknown The road of a pioneer is full of difficulties Next thing he does I already mentioned this earlier America is very important to our company So I'm going to move there I needed to know more about how Americans lived And how they thought I realized that my future would depend on the United States I would move my family to the United States And experience the life of an American Now Sony winds up being the first Japanese company To sell their stock in the United States So he says I realize what a disruption this move would be for my family But I'm a believer in the total immersion theory So his kids are young at the time His wife was a massive supporter of him So they literally come over And I think he's the only one that speaks any English His kids have to learn English They're going to school They're the only Japanese people there His wife has to build a social circle Where she doesn't even speak the language He's not exaggerating He says I'm a big believer in total immersion theory He then takes an idea that worked in Tokyo And he's going to import it into New York The way I would describe this is David Olgubi has this great line Where he says only first class business And that in a first class way I think Akio would agree with that So he had opened a showroom in the Ginza district in Tokyo Remember he was talking about earlier It's like I don't want people We put blood sweat and tears into making these products I don't want people in between us and our customer I'm just not interested in that So he opens a showroom in the Ginza district in Tokyo Where potential customers could try out the products With no salesmen around And it went to becoming a massively popular place For people to gather and to hang out He talks about the advertising value of that showroom was enormous And he's like okay if I want to do the same thing in New York Where do I go? He's like well if I want to reach the people who had the money To afford to buy our high priced products Then Fifth Avenue is obviously the place to find them So he takes the idea from the Ginza district And he does it on Fifth Avenue Now something that This is important because something that he repeats about the book It is our policy to charge a premium for our products We at Sony have always been fanatics about quality He talks about quality and high prices over and over again Abuqa and I knew we were after quality above every single thing And he knows to be the very best to go after the highest quality You have to be an extreme person with unreasonable Many people would deem unreasonable expectations And he applies it to himself, his kids, his business He applies it to maintaining physical and mental discipline This was very interesting So he says when I attended school, discipline was very strict And this included our physical as well as our mental training Our classrooms were very cold in the winter We didn't even have a heater And we were not allowed to wear extra clothes In the Navy, I was indoctrinated into hard training In boot camp every morning, we had to run long distances Before we could get our breakfast In those days, I did not think of myself as a physically strong person Yet under such strict training, I found I was not so weak after all And the knowledge of my own ability gave me confidence in myself That I did not have before It is the same with mental discipline Unless you are forced to use your mind, you become mentally lazy And you will never fulfill your potential And so he's talking about the schooling that he had The fact that other institutions and people held him to a high standard He wound up matching that standard That in turn gave him confidence And so he's looking around and he's like, well, Japanese schools have gotten soft I'm in America, he says most American schools are way too permissive So he winds up sending his son to a very strict boarding school So he lives his own philosophy He thought it was beneficial for his own life And then he passes on obviously to people inside Sony, but also to his family Now, I did come across one of these This is the single best idea The most memorable idea that I've never forgotten You know, when I read this book for the first time five years ago That I think can be applicable to anybody else And that is hire a paid critic So he finds this guy named Noria Oga Who was a vocal arts student at Tokyo University And he was testing and a fan of the early Sony products back in 1950 So he would test their very first audio tape recorder And Akio says I had my eye on Norio For a bunch of years because of his bold criticism of our first machine He was a great champion of the tape recorder But he was severe with us because he didn't think our early machine was good enough He was right, of course Our first machine was rather primitive We invited him to be a paid critic Even when he was still in school His ideas were very challenging This is what Noria said that he was trying to do with Sony He says a ballet dancer needs a mirror to perfect her style, her technique A singer needs the same His criticism and taste was so valuable that at the time the book was published Norio, who starts out as a paid critic, is now the president of Sony Another thing Akio preaches is he spent a lot of time Especially as he gets older, with the youngest Sony employees He would have dinner with them every night He'd surround himself with them They're obviously the ones that lead him to the latest ideas He gets older But he also genuinely cared for their well-being And didn't want them to stay at a company where they didn't believe in the mission Or they weren't happy I think this is advice he would give to younger people And I think it's just excellent If you're going to work in a job that you hate You're going to end up getting to the end of your life and hating your life Let's say you only work eight hours a day Like a normal schedule That's still half of the time that you're awake If you sleep for eight hours, you work for eight hours, you get eight other times Fifty percent of the time you're awake, you hate what you're doing How's it possible you're going to get to the end of your life? It's like, oh, I had a great life, it's just impossible Nobody can live twice in the next 20 or 30 years The brightest period of your life You only get it once When you leave the company 30 years from now And when your life is finished I do not want you to regret that you spent all those years here That would be a tragedy I cannot stress this point too much That it is your responsibility to yourself The most important thing in the next few months Is for you to decide whether you will be happy or unhappy here He learns a few things through spending time with all these young people in the company And he actually found a unique way to At this point, Sony is a massive company Tens of thousands of employees It's just impossible for him to know everybody like he did in the early days And so he found a unique way to identify bad managers So he says, I used to have dinner with many young lower management employees almost every night And we would talk until late And so he's having this conversation one night And this person keys him in on the fact that he has a blind spot that he needs to fix Before I joined this company, I thought it was fantastic It's the only place I wanted to work But I work for this section chief and he represents the company But he is stupid And everything I do or suggest has to go to this guy I'm very disappointed that this stupid section chief is Sony as far as my career is concerned This was a sobering thought for me I realized there might be many employees in our company with problems like this And we should be aware of their dilemmas I started a weekly company newspaper Where we would advertise job openings in other parts of the company This and then we made it possible for employees to apply to those other jobs confidentially Why is that so smart? We've had many cases when we discovered a manager was inadequate Because so many people working under him asked to be transferred We learn a lot by listening to our employees Wisdom is not the exclusive possession of management And he talks more and more about his management philosophy He talks about the difference where most of his competitors thought he had an advantage Because they essentially managed for like next quarter And he was fine making investments that will pay off 5-10 years in the future Especially around marketing and advertising And launching of a new product Like if he does a great job and invests a lot of money into educating customers about the product Making more people aware of the product's existence It may look like he's spending a lot of money now But if you can turn these people into fans and customers of your company for 5-10 years Think about not only how much money they'll buy in other products for your company But how many other people they tell about the company Which is very... It seems like that should be obvious But if you actually look at... And he talks about this a lot If you actually look at the behavior of people It's just so natural for them to err on the short term So he says the world of business has some peculiarities The remarkable thing about management is that a manager can go on for years Making mistakes that nobody is aware of Because management is an elusive thing It cannot be judged by next quarter's bottom line Managers can look good on the bottom line But at the same time they can be destroying the company by failing to invest in the future A Sony president was reluctant to spend the money on promoting a new product He said if we spent a lot and it didn't bring in enough sales We would lose money I told him over and over again You must consider the return that comes in 5-10 years Not just the immediate return They wind up... This goes on for a while in the book They keep fighting The Sony president and Akio keep fighting About the advertising and marketing plan for this new product So they went fighting about this for quite a while And then Akio can't sleep one day And just calls him in the middle of the night And he goes I finally said if you're not going to spend a million or two million dollars In this campaign in the next two months I'm going to fire you My argument again and again Was that by saving money instead of investing it In the business you might gain a profit On a short term basis But in actual fact you are cashing in on assets That have been built up in the past So that is why they are constantly If they just said We're going to make the Sony Walkman Maybe the Walkman is successful For 10 years, 15 years Eventually they know they are in a technology business They can't stop it He talks about over and over again He would teach his manager We need to harness technology You can't fight against it It's a phenomenon that we have to utilize There's nothing we can do We have to learn the new technology And we have to use it to invent new products He talks about over and over again The way that Akio would educate customers About a new product Was actually inspired by a very old Japanese tradition I'm going to attempt to pronounce this You know how it goes with me in pronunciation Nimawashi The thing that Educating customers And Nimawashi Both have in common Is time One must prepare the groundwork among the customers Before you can expect success in the marketplace It is a time honored Japanese gardening technique To prepare a tree for transplant For transplanting by slowly and Carefully binding the roots Over a period of time Bit by bit To prepare the tree for the shock of the change It is about to experience This process called Nimawashi Takes time and patience But it rewards you if it is done properly With a healthy transplanted tree Advertising and promotion For a brand new innovative product Is just as important Another line from the book That can serve as a maxim You need to air condition your factories before your offices If Japanese clients come into an office Of a new company and see plush carpet And private offices in too much comfort They become suspicious that this company is not serious That it is devoting too much thought And company resources to management's comfort And perhaps not enough to the product Or potential customers This is going to sound exactly what Steve Jobs said When he came back to Apple by the way Akio says, that is exactly my sentiments The investment should go into those things That relate directly to the product Too often I have found in dealing with foreign companies That such superfluous things As the physical structure and office decor Take up a lot more time And attention and money That they are worth In fact, there's a great line from one of Steve Jobs biographies Right before he comes back to Apple This guy named Gil Amelio Is the CEO of Apple And so it says Steve Jobs believed that Amelio had maneuvered himself Into the gig by positioning himself As a turnaround expert And then this line from Steve just makes me laugh But how can he be a turnaround expert When he eats his lunch alone in his office With food served to him on China That looks like it came from Versailles This also speaks to again The directness, the clarity of thought And the self-confidence that Akio had Once Sony is really successful All these countries ask him to come and visit And help them, you know You built one of the most successful Manufacturing and technology companies In the war torn ashes in Japan We may be poorer countries as China in the 1970s Soviet Union in the 1970s Can you help us do it? His whole point is he knows If people are serious about the work that they are doing Because if you actually care about the product that you are making And the company that you are building Then you stay in the details And it is obvious when you don't stay in the details So he takes this tour in 1974 to the Soviet Union And because they are like We want to work with Sony, can maybe you move some of your manufacturing here And he looks at the place This is just not going to happen In Japan, this is what he told them In Japan we use our top talent and our best brains And spend years seeking ways to increase The efficiency and productivity Of even such a simple thing as a screwdriver We have racked our brains And we have done a lot of studies and experiments To decide just what is the exact and precise temperature For a soldering iron in each particular application You do not make any such effort here There appears to be no need to do it Because no one seems to care And so he gives them Really good advice And it is exactly what Edwin Land from Polaroid Built his career off of And what Steve Jobs learned from Edwin Land It is the combination of art and technology Of liberal arts and technology Building at that intersection And he is like Russia Has this, all this history of great art If you have art and you have technology Why do you not combine them to come up with Some wonderful things He is essentially describing what they did at Sony And one of the things That he repeats over and over again That he thinks gave them a great advantage He is not positioning the book As like look we had to deal with all this crap We had to build Sony And you know burn out department store He actually thought that designing constraints And being forced to be resourceful On an individual company and country level Was a huge advantage Because most of his competitors are so wasteful So you can think about what he is about to say here Is like being wasteful is the opposite of resourcefulness One of the most significant value concepts That we have cherished from ancient times Is this term pronounced Motaini It is a key concept One that may help explain a great deal about Japan The Japanese people and our industry It is an expression that suggests That everything in the world is a gift from the creator And that we should be grateful for it And never waste anything We Japanese feel that All things are provided as a sacred trust And are actually only Loaned to us to make the best use of To waste something Is considered a sin We have developed this concept That goes beyond mere frugality or conservation It is a religious concept The wasting of anything Was considered shameful And virtually a crime We have always had to practice conservation For survival We have learned how to be efficient We looked at all of our factory operations And our products and made design changes Where we could save even small Amounts of energy We have also re-studied all forms Of power consumption at Sony In our factories and in our offices And in our products When you were told From childhood that the metal object That you hold in your hands Comes from an iron ore Mined in countries far away Which is transported to Japan at great expense And is produced in furnaces That use gas and coal From other far away places Such objects seem very Valuable I am reminded of the American expression There's plenty more where that came from We have no such Expression We must all learn how to be more skillful We must learn new technologies to survive We must always create more opportunities And he does a great job of showing that we can Identify and create opportunities just with the Right perspective in our mind This is exactly how he started Sony if you think about Where we started the podcast at I am reminded of the story of the Two shoe salesmen who visited An underdeveloped country One cabled his office No prospects of sales because nobody wears shoes here The other salesman cabled Send stock immediately Inhabitants barefooted And desperately need shoes And that is where I'll leave it For the full story Highly recommend reading the book If you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes On your podcast player you'll be supporting the podcast At the same time I'll also leave a link down below Make sure you're on my personal email list I email the top ten highlights for every single book I read that's available at davidcenter.com And you'll find it down below That is 386 books down One thousand to go and I'll talk to you again soon
