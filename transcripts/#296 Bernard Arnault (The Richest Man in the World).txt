--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm the boss. I should be here on Monday morning and I should be running the company in person." LVMH had entered a new chapter of its history. Bernard Alnol had taken power. He did not realize how harsh his words sounded. That was not the type of thing that he cared about. For him, the stakes were altogether different. Yesterday, he had taken over Busak, the ailing textile empire. Today, he was in control of LVMH. A few days before his 40th birthday, this youngster was at the head of the most expensive company in France. As chairman of the world's leading manufacturer of luxury goods, he now owned the most prestigious French brands. Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix, Givonti, Moet, Hennessy, and Louis Vuitton, all acquired in less than five years. He was the first of a new breed of capitalists. Friday the 13th, January 1989 was the day that he took office. The 15 people invited to witness the event at LVMH's head office were beginning to filter into the large conference room. They each had played a decisive role in this affair, which had all the makings of a Greek tragedy. They all knew they had no choice but to go along with Arnol. He quickly inspected those present. Only one was missing, Henri Racomir, the chairman of Louis Vuitton. This senile old fool, as he had started to call him, was really beginning to get on Bernard's nerves. He had to get rid of him as soon as possible. The noise of the door opening interrupted his thoughts. Racomir made an entrance. This was merely the first step. Racomir would fight to the end against this youngster whom he had sought out a year before in the hopes of neutralizing the insufferably pretentious Alain Chevalier. This is the guy that was running Moet Hennessy before it merged with Louis Vuitton. A mistake which had backfired on him. But Racomir had no intention of letting himself be pushed around. This 76-year-old was thirsting for revenge. From now on, he would wake each morning vowing to topple Arnol. If he had one quality, it was perseverance. At 1130 a.m., a triumphant Bernard Arnol arrived at Moet Hennessy. He was anxious to personally check the text which announced his election. Two draft press releases had been prepared. The first and longer one paid homage to the previous management. The second simply announced the appointments without any frills. Bernard chose the second. He took out a pen and struck out the words of praise for the former managing director. Reading through it again, Bernard added, That was an excerpt from this unbelievably difficult book to find and the one that I'm going to talk to you about today which is The Taste of Luxury, Bernard Arnol and the Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton story and is written by two French authors. I have no idea unfortunately how to pronounce their names but I will leave their full names in the show notes. And before I jump into the book, I need to thank my friend David Rosenthal from the Excellent Acquired podcast. He actually found this book was first published in 1992 in French. I've only found one other copy. The one copy that I can find that's for sale right now is $3,000. David paid almost $400 for this book and he gave it to me for free so I could make this episode. So to prepare for this episode, in addition to reading this entire book, I also listened to David and Ben's Excellent Acquired episode. It's called LVMH. I will leave the link down below where you can just search in your podcast player for acquired and it should be easy to find their episode. It's titled LVMH. It's like three and a half hours long. It tells the entire history, the entire history of how LVMH came to be. I took notes on their episode and you should hear some of those notes in this episode today. In addition to that, I also listened to the Excellent episode of Business Breakdowns. It's titled LVMH, The Wolf and Cashmere's Conglomerate and that business breakdown is about what LVMH looks like today, their business models and their financial performance. And I, of course, am going to focus on Bernard O'Nalt, the person, as I always do. Let me go right into Bernard's early life. He's born in France in 1949 and he's the son of a building contractor. He's the third gen. He's going to end up being the third generation in this family business. His father Jean was successful. Life was comfortable without being ostentatious. Sometimes Bernard would stand in the hall gazing at a portrait of his ancestor, whom he apparently resembled. This ancestor was a colonel in the Napoleonic Guard and had served in all the emperor's campaigns. If in case you missed it, I just did a first of many episodes I'm going to do on Napoleon because Napoleon just pops up again and again in these, if you're reading biographies on history, history, entrepreneurs, pre-World War II, they're going to constantly reference their studying and their admiration of Napoleon. That's episode 294, if you haven't listened to it. I just got a fantastic book called The Mind of Napoleon printed in 1955. It arrived a few days ago, so I'll do an episode on that soon as well. In the book starts out, okay, we got this young, studious, driven, I guess I should tell you this upfront that I didn't understand until I read this book and then listened to both the acquired and the business breakdowns episodes. What pops out is my mind is like Bernard is like this odd combination of I would say Warren Buffett and a John D Rockefeller. If you've listened to my episodes on Rockefeller, I think I've done three or four at this point, you'll see there's a lot of parallels in his life other than Rockefeller was poor and Bernard was not, but this is just idea where it's all work, no fun. We just have this young version of, I think it's like 10 years old time, we have young Bernard just looking at this picture of one of his great ancestors. It says he was an excellent pupil. He was in the top of his class in all subjects, including PE. The boy would listen attentively, a habit that he was never to lose. That sentence reminded me of one of my favorite lines that I've heard in any of the biographies that I've read came from episode 213 in Michael Jordan's autobiography. Michael Jordan says successful people listen, those that don't listen don't last long. Following ward four two, his grandfather Savinelle, obviously, you know, if you listen to a bunch of these, I can barely pronounce English. These are all French names, there's just no way I'm getting this correct. I sat and listened to correct pronunciations over and over again to no avail. It's just better if I just spend that time reading instead. So his grandfather starts this engineering and building company. And he does it in France after World War One, because everything was destroyed in France after World War One. So everything has to be rebuilt. Bernard is going to work in this company that still exists when he's a young man, starting with nothing. They're talking about his grandfather, except his wheelbarrow. He teamed up with another guy that his his partner who supplied the capital and began to build on the ruins. At that time, textiles, this is crazy. At that time, textiles were the wealth of the north of France, and Marcel Boussac was at his peak. Bernard's grandfather's company built a factory for the textile king. Now, why is that crazy? Boussac is going to be the company that 35 year old Bernard buys. Boussac, and the reason he buys is because this is this conglomerate that is now taken over by the French government. It's losing a ton of money. And one of the assets that this conglomerate has is Christian Dior. Bernard targets Boussac because he wants Dior. That is the first in a chain of events that's going to eventually lead him to overtaking and taking over LVMH. Let's go back to his childhood. I just got to pull some quotes. I went looking because he's got a fantastic quote spread over the internet. And he says, I'm very competitive. I always want to win. The way I would describe his childhood is work, work, work, and more work. He was reared on his grandmother's stories. This studious young Bernard did not like play like other children. He did not like playing. That is repeated in different sections of the book. What Bernard liked as a child was the quiet, studious life he led at his grandmother's. He loved work and music. While his friends from his preparatory class were living it up, Bernard worked. This is one of his great quotes. It gives you an indication, the reason I wanted to go around collecting his quotes in this book and otherwise is because it really gives you an insight into his personality and who he is. And this is exactly what he does. You have to be specially gifted or you have to work hard, he said. I was not gifted enough. That's a lie. I was not gifted enough. I had to work, so I worked. He's both unbelievably gifted and unbelievably hardworking. You couldn't compete with him, said one of his closest friends. It wasn't worth it. He was quicker to grasp things. He went at a faster pace. You either detested him or found him charming. A lot of people were jealous of his abilities. So even when he's in college, this whole idea of work, work, work, let's get this done. Let's get big fast. Let's get on with what we're trying to do in life. He has this rare combination of he's intolerant of slowness and he has an unbelievably long-term view. And I think it's very, has been beneficial. Remember, this book ends way to get to the end of the book, what he says. He is 42 and what he says is ridiculous in the sense that he could think he could ever stop. And we see that, you know, what he's done multiple decades since then, but he's in college at this point and he has to take this training course that was with McKinsey, the management consultants. And he did not like it. He says, the very idea of a training course seemed frustrating to him. You watch, but you don't do anything, he said. And what I'm interested is in doing. He was 22 and in a hurry. He had never really considered anything else since his childhood. I always wanted to manage a company. I never wanted to do anything else. This reminds me of a young Paul Allen and a young Bill Gates sitting there reading, I forgot what it was, like Forbes magazine or Fortune magazine. I think they're like 12 or 13. And they're thinking of, oh my God, one day do you think we'll be able to run a company? And so this idea where he's like, you know, I never wanted to do anything else but manage a company. I knew this is what I was going to do. What I wrote down in the margin as well. There's no way that this guy was going to retire at 70 years old. And what I found fascinating about this is you have the same description of Bernard's. This is the time he was a really young kid when he's in like primary school and college. Now he's out of college and he's working. He's just like, okay, this guy works unbelievably hard. He's exceptionally bright. That is another quote here. And we also see that he has a lot in common with not only Rockefeller, but a lot of history, education, and training that you and I study. Bad boys move in silence. Nobody realized that he was married. He did not wear a wedding ring and he kept his own counsel. The day his daughter was born, not even his own secretary knew about it. He believed in extreme discretion. So he's working in his dad's company and he does something that this is, if you listen to the episode, episode 295 titled, I had dinner with Charlie Munger. Something I got to talk personally with Charlie Munger about was this idea. It's really important. And something that Charlie Munger did, something that Ben Franklin did, something Andrew Carnegie did. They purposely sought out other high performing intelligent people and made relationships with them. This is just the first example of many, many times Bernard's going to do this in his career. He's working with Pierre, I don't know his name, Pierre Gaud. I'm just going to call him Pierre. He's working with Pierre. They say Pierre at this time in Bernard's career is his alter ego. Initially, relations between Bernard and Pierre were distant and purely professional. People had, this is the reason, this is the entire reason I'm reading this section to you. People had to prove themselves before they won Arnaud's confidence. They had to be good and they had to know how to stand up to him when they were sure of their case. And so on these Post-It notes, I probably have, I don't know, 50 Post-It notes throughout this entire book. I wrote down relationships, relationships, relationships over and over again. We see this, that this is something that Bernard's going to do for the next two decades to when this book ends. Price still does it to this day. He's just constantly building relationships to people that are very similar to him in the sense of like driven, talented, and can help him achieve his goals. Go back to, then the book goes into great detail about what I would consider like his personality and management style. This is what I meant about Rockefeller. He is very Rockefeller-esque. He had perfect manners, so did Rockefeller. He hates intimacy, so did Rockefeller. He does not have friends, only loyal followers, so did Rockefeller. And then Bernard's going to do exactly what Rockefeller did early in his career when he jumps into the oil industry. At first, at the first he's like on the field, he's learning everything about it, and then he steps back and becomes this like master strategist. Bernard visited sites, talked to the subcontractors, and learned his trade as a contractor. Very quickly, he began questioning everything, so did Rockefeller. Demanding some, he was demanding and sometimes difficult to follow. And as we see, he had no plans to stay in the construction and engineering business, even though I think it was both on the acquired episode and the business breakdown episode where they talk about that Bernard is very much like an engineer by training. He had this like unique combination of an engineering mindset and an artistic mindset. And there's also quotes that he said later in his career that give you that indication as well. So his dad does something actually really smart, knows his son's talented, kind of willing to go along with him. And Bernard is also this financial genius, right? There's definitely a Warren Buffett aspect to him that I didn't understand before I read this book or listened to those two episodes. And so he's actually going to sell his dad's company. And he says, hilarious. Bernard then set up a development study, a subsidiary. I'm not going to go into that because there's so many. This, the construction of his businesses are so difficult to understand that there's multiple times where the authors find it prudent to print out flow charts of all of the different companies and how they interact with each other. And so the reason I wanted to bring up the development subsidiary is because what happens after the fact, so it says within five years, this company become the leading French property developer for private houses. Success came with the decision to sell holiday homes, a good knowledge of building and a careful use of marketing and advertising techniques. But the important part was his managing style, which he still holds to this day. Success came through the demands made by the owner on his employees. One day he was driving with one of his executives who complained he had too much work and could not do what was asked of him. He thought he had convinced Bernard, but when they arrived, Bernard said to him, as if the conversation had not taken place, you do agree to do what we talked about, don't you? Another day, Bernard had a file for a property deal on one of his employees desk at midday at 2 p.m. Two hours later, he called and asked him how much he had sold to unbelievably demanding, wanting to move fast, wanting, there's no limit to his ambition. As we see, you don't become the richest man in the world if you had that. And we see that even he's in his mid-twenties, I think at this point. And it says beneath this is, he says, the success that he was having. So he might be, let's say late twenties, maybe early thirties at the most. The success of this company was not enough for Bernard beneath his civilized appearance. There lurked the spirit of an adventurer. He wanted more. So he decides, hey, France is not big enough. He's going to go to the business mecca in the world. He's going to go to the United States. It is hilarious. Later on, he's running, I think the biggest export of the French economy to this day is luxury goods. And he is viewed very much by the French establishment, not as a Frenchman, but as an American. And so this is like the beginning of that. So he says he took to look for investment opportunities elsewhere. He headed for a country which he had loved, the United States. So he winds up moving there and then he winds up living in this neighborhood in New York. And it says while he's jogging in the mornings, he would pass his next door neighbor. It was quite a surprise when he learned from the front page of the Wall Street Journal that his neighbor was none other than John Kluge, the multimillionaire who had made a, who had just made a takeover bid for the communications conglomerate Metro Media. This book says multimillionaire. When I listened to the acquired episode, I think John was one of the richest, if not the richest people in the world. Shortly after this, he went to making, he was doing like these leverage buyouts. And I think these like takeovers, I think they said, and this book, it says multimillionaire. But in the episode, the acquired episode, they said he made $5 billion, I think on that deal. This is important because Arnold's going to use some of these techniques. This is why I'm giving you this background. Kluge embodied everything Arnold admired. He was a nationally successful businessman, his audacity in business and his display of wealth combined with a certain simplicity in his private life. That's why he's looking up to him. He wanted, Bernard wanted to go far. He had an iron will at a laboriously won, oh my goodness, this needs to be a t-shirt. He wanted to go far. He had an iron will at a laboriously won tennis match. He once said, I may lose once, but I never lose twice. So it's at this point, he decides to go back to France and he calls Pierre and he says, it's time to go to France and buy a company. Find me one. He chose Dior. There isn't a better name in the United States. The president of Dior is better known than the president of France, Arnaud said. And just as a quick aside, the chapter titles in this book are excellent because they're all descriptions of Bernard. And so this one is called a burning ambition. And this is the perfect timing because this is the 1980s. In the crazy 80s, there's all a bunch of buyouts, takeovers, LBOs, raids. This is all pre LVMH. So Boussac at the time, which is the large conglomerate that I referenced earlier, that his grandfather happened to build the textile mill for a long time ago, was the largest industrial bankruptcy bankruptcy in France in French history at the time. And the public authorities in France are anxious to rid themselves of a business that was losing them a hundred million francs a month. And so these are just some of the assets that are inside this giant money losing empire. I wonder if I should find a book on the founder. It says it all began in 1978 with the collapse of the Boussac empire, the man who had invented pajamas. That's odd. And discovered a young fashion designer Christian Dior and who was one of the six wealthiest men in the country was unwilling to modernize his factories, far less lay off any of his workers. He had to sell his stud farms. So I guess it was the horses, his chateau and his newspapers. All that remained of the depleted empire were assets in the declining textile industry, which just like Buffett, eventually Bernard's going to sell off and one jewel, Christian Dior. And so there's a bunch of other potential buyers for this. There's a bunch of lessons spread across the next few pages. Here's the first one, something you and I have talked about over and over again in the past. It's one of the greatest quotes from entrepreneur history ever. You see it over and over again. It's from Henry Kaiser. Problems are just opportunities and work clothes. Bernard had become the most serious would be buyer. He saw problem cases as a challenge. After all companies are in ruins, hold the greatest surprises and bring the greatest profits. If they can be pulled around, all you have to do is delve into them deeper than anyone else and work on them without leaving anything to chance. That description dealt deeper than anyone else would and work on them without leaving anything to chance. That sounds like a description of Bernard, the person. Number two, and getting Dior, he's going to get one, his sights are set like this. I reference like the Terminator esque feeling that you get when you read about Rockefeller. I felt the same way when I'm reading about a young Bernard. Like it's like I have my eyes set on this thing and I'm just going to do whatever I can. I don't care. Whatever barrier you put up in front of me, I'm going to figure this out one way or another. In this case, his first objective is like, I'm going to get Dior one way or the other. He tries to buy it piecemeal. It's like, I'd rather just have Dior. I don't want all this other boo sack stuff. But you said, no, okay, that's fine. I'm going to get Dior no matter what. He put forward his proposal to take over Dior. Out of the question, they said, it must be all or nothing. No matter, all it would be. You are quite mad, his father told him. Then one of his other advisors say, hey, why don't you take the first plane back to United States? They thought this was crazy. The people that are telling him, no, you have to buy the whole thing. You can't buy Dior are the ones that actually own boo sack now, even though they're losing much money. I think there's like four brothers. They're called the Willets. Really, you don't have to remember that. It's not important to the story. What is important to me or to the story, by the way, is if you are the one with cash, time is your friend. These guys own this company, but they're just getting drained constantly. They have pressure from the French government to figure this out. And so Bernard's like, okay, I'm just going to wait. I'm going to reach out. So says the brothers arrogantly stuck to their guns are now convinced that it's time past the brothers position would become increasingly untenable. This is exactly so when I wrote, when I got to this section, this is something that Charlie Munger said at the dinner. He says, we made a lot of money because we always had a lot of cash and we could move fast. And his point there is like, he told some stories about this, like you can have an asset that's hypothetically worth $2 billion. There's some kind of either the blow up of an individual company or like this large recession. And suddenly you picked up something for 450 million that's worth 2 billion. It's if you have cash time is your friend, you're going to be able to wait these people out. And this is exactly what happens in this situation. Going back to the Terminator, right? Arnaud was determined he wanted Boussac and he was going to get it. He would apply himself to the task of attaining the support of the public authorities who would choose the buyer. So this is the first thing. First time I wrote down what I mentioned I have on a bunch of post-it notes, relationships, relationships, relationships. This is an attack vector that Bernard uses over and over and over again. Next page, I wrote giant capital letters, never underestimate it is all downside and no upside. This is something else that repeats in human nature over and over again. You and I have seen it in multiple stories. They don't take them seriously. There's other buyers like, we don't have to worry about this guy. Who is he? Like, we're going to win this. And that's the problem. There is, I even adopted this like to change my behavior. It's like, first, I try to limit like, doing deals outside, you know, with external people. But if I did, I would just assume like, okay, that person, even if they're showing no signs of this is true, just think that that person is a secret genius that they know way more than you. This idea where you're going to underestimate them like, oh, I'm smarter, I'm going to beat them or whatever case is like, okay, like maybe they may be hiding something. The point is, even if it's great, it's all downside, no upside. What's the point? I would do the reverse, right? They'll never give BOSAC to a 36 year old property developer living in the United States, trumpeted this other buyer, sure of himself. Everyone underestimated Bernard. That's exactly what's going to happen, man. What is the point of underestimating somebody? Arnaud remained inflexible. He wanted control. There was no question of his becoming the brother's partners. These are the willettes. They're like, oh no, you know, we don't want to sell this. There's, we're four brothers. We just want a fifth brother. That is a consistent theme throughout life of Bernard. He is a dictator. He is going to be in control. You're out of your mind. If you think you're going to partner with this guy, going back to first, they criticize you. Then they copy you. I got a great quote about him. I'm going to read after this. Everyone discouraged him. Remember they said, hey, you're crazy. Get on a plane. Oh, they're not going to sell it to them. Everyone discouraged them. They're telling them, oh, don't get involved. These are all different quotes, right? Spread over multiple pages. Everyone discouraged him. Don't get involved. You will fare no better than your predecessors. You won't last three years. And this is how you know we're dealing with somebody unique and different. Listen to his reaction. Far from discouraging him, this consensus of opinion acted as a stimulus. That is a sign that you're dealing with somebody that has put the work in necessary to trust his own judgment later in life. This is what he says. I remember people telling me, it doesn't make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success. It was a recognized success. And for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate. I think they are not successful, but they'll try again. First they criticize you, then they will copy you. A few pages ago, I referenced this idea. Hey, if you're the one with cash, time is your friend. Turns out that was correct. Negotiations were broken off. You know, they're fighting. We can't figure it out. However, the following day, the situation changed again for one essential reason. The tribunal, this is the French government, was to announce liquidation on November 16th. The Willots had their back against the wall and on November 14th, they signed the agreement. And so now that Bernard has this agreement signed with the brothers, he goes and does relationships, relationships, relationships. He goes and actually tours all of, starts building relationships with all the important decision makers inside the French government to hold off liquidation. So it says, as soon as the agreement had been ratified, Arnaud and his partner went to the Ministry of Justice. The two men did the rounds of all the ministries to convince them methodically. The two men toured the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs. Tirelessly, they explained and argued, trying to persuade the various advisors that they were serious and that their plan was feasible. And this was not easy. They had reservations about how able and industrialist he was. Remember, he's really young at this time, how solid his financial backing was. Here too, Bernard surprised everybody. This is not somebody, I just, it just hit me now reading this. These, usually I read the highlights several times before I sit down and talk to you. Like this is exactly how he gets into LVMH. He's underestimated by the guy that he's fighting at the very beginning of the book, Racamir. He's like, oh, we're old, let's bring in, let's bring in, they're trying to off, I'll get to this later, but they're trying to avoid a hostile takeover. So they want some allies. That's why he's called the wolf. And they're like, we're old. Maybe this Bernard guy, he thinks like about this industry like we do. Maybe he can succeed. Yeah, he's going to succeed you, but he's going to be like, oh, that's a nice business you have there. I'm not going to wait five years, 10 years, I'm going to actually control it now. And so that's another example of somebody underestimating him. This is amazing. So it says, they had reservations about how able and industrious he was, how solid his financial backing was. Here too, Bernard surprised everyone. He would gain the support of some of the biggest names in France and French finance. One of those is this Lazard Bank. It still exists to this day. It's mysterious and powerful. Let's just put it that way. So they play a huge role. His mentor is actually plays a very important role and works at Lazard for that. But the reason the details, I guess, aren't too important. It's this idea of building relationships and gaining support. You have to be an impressive person first. Bernard impresses everybody and meets them. And that makes it easier for him to gain support of powerful people. There's a line from the Tao of Charlie Munger, which is what I also covered in the last episode, where Charlie can't get into, he's rejected to Harvard Law School. He has a friend that used to be like the former dean that just happened to live in Nebraska. He makes one call and suddenly that rejection is reversed. And his takeaway, Charlie's takeaway from that was that he had never forgotten the importance of having friends in high places. I would say Bernard intentionally cultivated relationships with people in high places. And his career and work benefited enormously from doing so. So now Bernard is the owner of this ailing giant empire that's losing much money. He's going to make quick work and turn that around. I think in a couple years from now, on the acquired episode, they said he was within like two or three years, took a failing asset and wind up producing like 100 million in cash flow. But the one thing that he's focused on, and this is the really lesson, I think, to you and I is like a powerful brand is magic. If you have a powerful brand, all these other things can be fixed. I don't know if Bernard knew that at this point in his career, but he damn sure knows it now. Bernard had understood that Dior was a jewel in the crown of this group. Dior was to be the starting point for his strategy. It was Dior was a famous name, but they had innumerable difficulties. So just poorly run business, essentially what they're saying, they have too many licenses, not enough boutiques, they're ready to where collection had been a failure. They had a troubled atmosphere, a bad culture. It was impossible to manage the patchwork of 260 licenses worldwide. All this such as just listing off these problems that Bernard has to solve. But again, a powerful brand is magic. All these other things can be fixed, but you can't just snap your fingers and say, let me create a powerful brand. He's got something that's rare and very differentiated and valuable. It was impossible to manage the patchwork of 260 licenses worldwide, which attracted considerably from the image that a company like Dior should project. Quality was lacking. And that is going to lead to Bernard realizing, hey, something that he continues to say he wants to own his own distribution. It's extremely important. It's valuable then really valuable. Now, before I get there, though, something else that popped out of the book that was very interesting is Arnaud always bets on talent. My friend Sam Hinkie has this great quote. He says people are really, people really are power law, and the best ones change everything. And I think Bernard would agree with that. So he finds he's introduced to this young designer named Christian LeCroll. I actually looked that name up. There's a funny video on, I typed in how to pronounce Christian LeCroll on YouTube. And it's just like two guys sitting there just repeating it over and over again. It was actually really, really funny. And one guy's French, so he has a way better accent than I do. So anyways, Bernard immediately sees, oh, this guy's special. I don't care. He's so special, I'll make a plan for him. So it says Bernard was interested in this underappreciated designer. He was certain that he should not let Christian LeCroll slip through his fingers. That's exact. Rockefeller would hire people. Check this out. This is the same thing that's happening over and over again. It's crazy how similar these two are. Rockefeller meets somebody, he thinks they're valuable, he would hire them just as meeting them and worry about what to do with them later. He just knew that talent was everything. So it says they're going to wind up launching this business together. They launched a great fashion house, and he invested 70 million francs down initially, and then they agreed to invest another 200 to 250 million francs over the next five years. Large point here, just remember, he always bets on talent. So let's go back to what I just mentioned, that he wants to own his own distribution. He is a learning machine. He's like, this doesn't make any sense what Dior is doing, we're going to change that learning from what he saw at Dior, Arnaud made another choice. The strategy of exclusive shops along the lines of what Chanel Hermes is doing. A network of shops is not built overnight. This took a long time to construct. This is what I mean if you hear him talk. He says, let me find the actual quote. Here it is. He says, in business, I think the most important thing is to position yourself for long term and not be too impatient, which I am by nature and I have to control myself. So he's willing to invest on a long term, even if it goes against his nature. That speaks to his discipline. They talk about Terminator. Let's go back to that idea of Bernard Terminator, Arnaud, however you say his name. A network of shops is not built overnight. It took a long time to construct. Well, he's still in the business. That's good. Those investments reap and compound over a long time. It doesn't make sense if you're going to get into a business, jump around like most entrepreneurs do. But Bernard was like, oh, I'm doing this forever. I'm going to stay in here and I'm going to build this thing and we'll see how far it can go. And he did something smart. He did not, I always say, worst thing you could do is usually when people have a success, they let their foot off the gas or they get comfortable. And the line that's in my own mind to avoid that is if you go to sleep on a win, you're going to wake up with a loss. He did not go to sleep on a win. He's not going to wake up with a loss. Arnaud did not stray from his path. Relentlessly, he pursued his ascent and seized every passing opportunity. I know I left myself on that page is like Jeff Bezos. Arnaud is relentless. Of course, we know Bezos owns relentless.com to this day, he almost named Amazon relentless.com, which is one of the things I love about Jeff. And this chapter ends with just one sentence. Bernard on all its upward mobility was gaining momentum. So in the background, the environment that allows him to end up getting control, eventually getting control. One of the things that helped him get control of LVMH is this fact that there is the deregulation of the market in 1984. In the Paris that the Paris Stock Exchange experienced a new awakening is the line in the book. This is what I mentioned earlier about the crazy 80s. Anyway, it's study this period knows is just absolutely insane buyouts, takeovers, reads, so it's buying into LVMH, I think in 1987, and has complete control by 1989. I think let's go back to the beginning of the book to make sure I'm right. Yeah, Friday, January 13, January 1989. Okay. And we're also going to see that Bernard like most efficient creation entrepreneurs, they use these economic downturns to expand. Most humans just run away. They're in bad financial positions, they cower. And the people that actually go against human nature wind up making usually if they're picking good assets, usually make leaps and bounds in just a few years. So this is going to have that's the crash in October 1987, which I'll get to in a minute. But I need to give you he participated in corporate rating. The benefit of reading this book after David did is that I get to see his notes. So he wrote down on that page. Thank you very much for the value there. So he has a friend, I'm just gonna call him his French friend, I have no idea how to say his name. So his French friend became a specialist in a technique called greenmail. This consisted of buying a package of shares in a company vulnerable to takeover with which he renegotiated the buying back of the securities at a genuinely higher price. Sometimes Bernard accompanied his friends in these rates. And this is an incredible description of a young Bernard in contrast to those of his peers. His ambitions were not limited to getting rich quick. Capital above all had to serve his plans which were beginning to crystallize. He had such an appetite for victory and such a capacity for work that he was bound to succeed. I underlined that that line twice. He had such an appetite for victory and such a capacity for work that he was bound to succeed. His determined character attracted the attention of the biggest names in finance. This goes back to relationships, relationships, relationships. And he's doing exactly what Ben Franklin, Andrew Carnegie and Charlie Munger all did. They sought out high quality people. Bernard had the caliber of a great capital of industry. Remember he's in his mid-30s, early 30s when this is happening. He was a skillful negotiator. He surprised his partners in discussion with his self-assurance and knowledge. Remember when he was 10 years old all he wanted to do was study and work. See he's still working like that. All the more impressive in one so young. He had earned his spurs as far as the banking establishment was concerned. The day he bought all the shares from the Willop brothers, that episode was very revealing. And so I do not want to overwhelm you with detail here but I do think this is important because again this goes back to something that he just loves to eat. He's going to control as much of his business as possible. So he was raising money to buy out these brothers and I was like all right now I got to figure out a way to get rid of these guys. So he said he sought to establish his power definitively in Busak. He had to ensure almost total control of the group and to break away from the grip of the banking consortium which had helped him at the start. If he did not he would never have his hands free and would remain at the beck and call of the bankers. And as we've seen as his life plays out during and after this book, Bernard's not going to be at the beck and call of anyone. In fact I found this great quote of him online talks about the difference. He's like he was he really likes power. He likes power and he thinks that business people actually have like longer term power than politicians. People think of politicians having true power but that's less and less true. After all they are often constrained of being edged into a corner by a whole series of contingencies. I'm lucky in that I say I want my group to be in such a such position in 10 or 20 years time and then I formulate a plan to make that happen. He this is what I mean he's seeking out you know very like high quality people that can help his career. There's a list of these but really I think the most important one is Antoine Bernheim. I'm gonna call him Antoine. It says Antoine is the true architect of Bernard's meteoric career. Antoine had made Bernard his protege and a favorite of the Lazard stable. This is what I meant about this like financial mysterious and powerful organization. The banker was undoubtedly the one who fascinated the chairman of Dior the most. This is the interesting thing and maybe just because the book was translated from French but so many times throughout the book it gets confusing because instead of using his name they'll use the position he happens to hold at that time but it always changes. It's like just say who he was the banker undoubtedly was the one who fascinated Bernard the whole time and so we see that Bernard's getting this very valuable form of education because this banker Antoine is revealing to Arnaud the workings of the financial world which he mastered with Machiavellian perfection. Of Bernard so now you have the banker Antoine describing his protege. Of Bernard he said simply believe me he is very good. What did Antoine teach him? A perfect mastery of financial techniques it's this Russian doll ownership structure that Bernard uses. In fact the way to think about it I think Ben from acquired gave a great summary of this page. You can generate a ton of cash by selling minority pieces of each Russian doll. This generates huge leverage for Bernard. So says what did Antoine teach him? Instead of having the majority that is 51% of your money and of capital in company A it is better to have 51% in a purely financial company B which itself then holds 51% of company A. One therefore also has control of company A by dividing the initial capital outlay. This reasoning can be continued infinitely. That sounds confusing. They give you a great metaphor here to understand it. The basic concept of techniques is called cascades. Russian dolls are even stovepipe hats and it is old as the world itself. Why is this important? Because it allows targets to be attacked which are much bigger while avoiding the initiation of a costly takeover bid. A method tailor made for the French market at this point in history that's important to point out for the French market and for the appetite of Bernard and all. So says the magic formula did exist it was the stock exchange. The next time instead of counting on the financial support of investors which is what Bernard did to get control of Busac he would take the capital of his various companies to the stock market. Each call on the market would provide him with his initial capital outlay. The best way of orchestrating takeovers was with other people's money. The small shareholders who he's now bringing in would thus replace the bankers who he's trying to get rid of of his earlier operations. Here's the main punchline. This compartmentalized structure turned out to be a veritable treasure chest. Each time that he needed money Bernard put one of his subsidiaries on the stock market without losing overall control. So then a few pages later I'm reading about Bernard and this is what popped my mind as I get to the section. He is a financial genius and a dictator who's obsessed with efficiency. Bernard was one of the best financiers of his time. He loved buying restructuring buying again in order to restructure again. Behind his angelic appearance there looked an authoritarian proprietor. His managerial credo became American style management. That's what mentioned earlier how the French establishment views him very much as an American. He was not worried about charisma. What mattered with him was efficiency. This new type of businessman was going against received practice. That's an important note. Another way of saying that I trust my own judgment. The fact that he's he felt very comfortable going against received practice. His immediate priority was to find a target which was worthy of his ambitions. He did not hesitate to examine several companies a week in minute detail. There goes back to his obsession with detail his obsession with studying. So much so that he's he has a soundproof office which is hilarious because I record these podcasts in a soundproof booth. Looks like a phone booth that's soundproof. I should get a giant soundproof office now that uh and library now that Bernard has it. So he says he hesitated to examine several companies a week in minute detail. The stock market crisis of October 1987 attracted his attention to share which was plummeting in value. LVMH was now quoted at only 1200 francs. It was down 50 percent. So he goes to his mentor the guy Lazards and he's like let's launch a raid and Antoine gives him excellent advice. He says Antoine calmed him down. Wait until they come looking for you. Okay so at this point we need to introduce two characters that are really important to this story. They're going to be the two co-founders of LVMH. I had no idea that they were on their partnership only lasted a few months before Bernard comes in. So you have Henry Rocamere. He's one of the co-founders of LVMH because he's going to merge Louis Vuitton with Moet Hennessey. He is the one that turned Louis Vuitton into an international brand which was really fascinating because this book talks about the early history like Louis Vuitton is you know this monstrous business today. 1977 they have two stores and so there's some ideas that he used to build Louis Vuitton. I think you and I should should be aware of in case we can use it. The second co-founder and these two are going to hate each other by the way or is Alléon Chevalier. He is the one that ran Moet Hennessey. He merged Moet with Hennessey. He owned he also owned a license for the Christian Dior perfume. So at this point Bernard because he got Boussac owns Christian Dior but he doesn't own the Christian Dior perfumes. They're two separate businesses. Perfumes are probably if I'm not mistaken the more valuable like the more not the more valuable the more profitable the two lines. So these two guys come together which I'll read to you in a minute because they're worried about a takeover and they're both since okay if we combine ourselves we're less likely to be taken over and then they went up having a there's like a they just had they just clashed they have hilarious quotes in the book about like marrying a fish or something. I'll read to you in a minute. Their discontent opens the door to bring in Bernard and then not realizing that he just left let a wolf in the hen house and so eventually Bernard is not going to like either of these two men. That is not the case at the beginning. In fact it says Chevalier fascinated him. Bernard admired his high profile his cachet with the establishment and his international standing. He was dazzled by the elegance of the chairman of Moet. So that's an important thing where it says oh his profile his cachet with the establishment. Bernard is very much an outsider. He is you know in the north of France. He is in like the industrial region. He is not in this luxury world at all. In fact this part of the story reminds me of so I've watched and read all the Game of Thrones books and just finished re-watching the series again and I always take notes. I love these maxims these like prompts for thinking and I came across this fantastic line a few months ago and I think it describes exactly what's happening in this business this book right now. He says those on the margins often come to control the center. Those on the margins often come to control the center and the line I saved underneath that one is also a description of Bernard. The world is built by killers. Both of these men have since passed away but if they were alive and we can ask them I bet you they would say that Bernard on all was a killer and to use the line from Doug Leone on the his episode that he just did we don't invest like the best. A killer to get the job done. That was Doug describing him and his partner Mike who scaled Sequoia from 150 million dollar company to I think 85 billion dollars of asset center management. We were killers killers to get the job done. But what was fascinating one of the most fascinating parts of this business because I always think is like what is a real valuable industry right now that no one takes seriously because that happens over and over again. I was just rereading the highlights from the early one of the I read like 13 books on the early automobile 13 biographies on early automobile American automobile founders. What's fascinating is like when they start doing their experiments there's a line in the book where they're like for every one car on the road when they started their experiments there was 3600 horses in America and so it looked like oh nice little toy you have there. Oh isn't that cute that you're running this experiment not realizing that that industry that they're creating right in front of their eyes is going to be one of the most valuable industries ever created. And the luxury industry like the industry where LVMH is right now one of the biggest companies in the world Bernard and his family are the you know he's the richest person his family is one of the richest families in the world. 30 40 years ago they didn't even think it was a real industry and I wrote after I'll tell you what I wrote after this says in the 1980s the talk of luxury items was not welcome the term luxury still had connotations of the craftsman it had nothing to do with real industry Arnall changes that so let's go back to this idea of the importance of relationships. So in 1987 Moet entered a period of great anxiety three billion American dollars were looking for a French ally to attack Moet unknown hands were amassing large numbers of shares on the stock market the founder families of Moet Hennessy now only controlled 22% of the capital the Moet management was unable to identify the raider it soon became clear that the acquisitions were being carried out via this other company whose chairman was the French friend that I couldn't pronounce earlier that was that green male guy I mentioned earlier who was a friend of Bernard Arnall. So Moet goes for protection who do they go for protection they go to Lazards. The second in command of the bank of Lazards right is Antoine which is also Bernard's mentor so because Moet was trying to avoid getting raided this is where they push into this merger right which is going to do create the company that now Bernard controls and built all of his family's wealth LVMH and so then it gives us some background on how Henry I'm reading my own notes how Henry Rekimir ran Louis Vuitton expand control distribution do the opposite of low quality competitors so it says he had a double strategy he wanted to make Vuitton a high prestige brand name symbolizing luxury distant voyages and great adventures by means of a sophisticated advertising policy but also he wanted to sell throughout his products throughout the world and control and own his own distribution and this is what I meant earlier this shocked me 1978 there was only two Vuitton company owned shops one in Paris and one in Nice and so what he noticed what people were doing is that they would own distribution other companies would own distribution in high-end areas and yet they would outsource the creation of the product to like lower cost areas of the world what the book calls the far east and so Rekimir had this good idea is like what if we reverse that to supply the shops he decided to do the opposite of their competitors manufacturing in France to guarantee exceptional quality and then selling in the far east and this strategy works well there's like a period of about what what is that like eight years eight years goes by they own a bunch of shops and they're making 200 million a year in profit and so the chapter that's describing like Henry Rekimir's career it ends with this fantastic line that is like a precursor to where the story is about to turn and where to much to bernard's own benefit Rekimir's ambitions knew no bounds alliance with the greatest of the great did not hold any fears for him this was to be a great mistake why because he's going to merge with Moet Hennessy and then he's going to bring in the wolf and cashmere which causes him to be kicked out of the company in about a year and a half from here and so you have two founders merging together not realizing that they both want to run the show this is going to end disastrously the two co-founders of LVMH lose the war for control to bernard on alt and so first of all they didn't understand like they're incapable of working with each other they're too much alike as a matter of fact so this is the background before bernard gets introduced the two groups so this is now louis vuitton and then moat hennessy which is about to merge the two groups had everything in common the same aims the same background of family control a tradition going back more than a century and of course their culture the merger of the two companies could could only result in the birth of one of the greatest french institutions well in that part you're right it is going to create a great french institution it's not it's just not going to be run by you and wait till we get into the pettiness between these two co-founders which again the fact that they couldn't get wrong the fact that they picked the wrong partner was their death kneel i had a hilarious thought when i got to this part of the book that i wrote down on myself i don't have any tattoos but if i did uh this is what i said i should get two tattoos one on each forum one on one one forum says watch your costs and on the other forum it says control and so my favorite book out of you know the almost 300 books i've read for the podcast so far the one i keep talking about over and over again and in fact it's going to be episode 300 i just decided it was going to be last time i reread it it was episode 200 so i had the idea is like oh every 100 episodes i should just read dyson's autobiography the first one they wrote not the second one he wrote another great one that's episode 205 when he was like 70 but the one he wrote when he was like 45 after just going through 14 years of hell is just absolutely fantastic and so this idea of like having a tattoo that just says control right and i somewhere on like see every day is a line from dyson's autobiography where he says difference for the sake of it in everything because it must be better from the moment the idea strikes to the running of the business difference and retention of total control difference and retention of total control is the entire message that dyson is trying to get into the future generations of entrepreneurs brains by reading that book and that was all i was thinking about while i was reading this ridiculous like merger and then fight and then they try to reverse merger that which bernard's not going to allow at that point because he had too much control it was just absolutely like why are you doing this the biggest mistake is to relinquish your control if you maintain the control you'll get the money anyways and so let's go into why we think about that friction between the two most powerful men and lvmh surfaced immediately each one wanted to be preeminent and it's funny because uh shovelayer has this quote that happened before i think their agreement um he says groupings which do not follow any kind of industrial logic end up badly he said it's like a marriage between a carp and a rabbit so a fish and a rabbit naturally enough such unions usually end in divorce he did not know how right he was so the merger happens and this is what happens next they stepped up both their surface affability and their concealed deceit and so what does that mean they immediately start fighting over is okay where's the new headquarters of lvmh this is i wrote down here never underestimate human pettiness they pick a location but racamir says nope he's not even going to bother to visit why because the address did not suit him it was too close too close to moet so the search began again the ideal solution were for premises they were equal distance away from their two headquarters think about that the new proposed headquarters is too close to the former moet one and not close enough to louis vautan i will not go there you have to find one that is equal distance between the two existing headquarters that is ridiculous once they've solved that problem though now they have an office they start fighting over the interior design of the office co-founders that fight over everything especially the unimportant is the note i left on my on the page here the problem of office was settled and then the two men turned their attention to decoration each one wanted his own decorator the co-chairman took a malicious pleasure in provoking each other so i'm going to fight over the location office now we're fighting over the decoration office now we're going to go we're going to step up our level of pettiness we're going to fight over the new company letterhead but let's not stop there when we do promotions for our new company that we both want to succeed let's take something that should take two minutes and let's take this make it take hours the photo sessions for the fortune magazine which devoted its first edition to the alliance of the two great companies was also turbulent it took three hours to obtain a few photos of the two co-founders side by side the architects of lvmh could not agree on the brand of champagne that would appear in the photo and this wraps up this section this is why the in about inability of the lvmh co-founders to work well together is so important to understand personal differences made the whole structure more fragile personal differences made the whole structure more fragile this dissension at the top of lvmh opened up a breach for a potential intruder bernard terminator or nalt is common guys the dissension at the top of lvmh opened up a breach for a potential intruder this was to be bernardo nalt's opportunity he was already waiting in the wings and so when he sees that stock drop during the the crash of 1987 we remember it goes back to what charlie monger said more buffett says we're not rich because of intelligence we're rich because of temperament we go in we rush in when everybody else is running out in fact buffett has one of the greatest lines about this ever it is in his shareholder letters and he says we are equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival buffett has a very positive affable public persona that is cold-blooded we play offense while others scramble for survival bernard is doing the exact same thing at this point in his life so let's go into that secretly bernard acquired his first shares he was moving forward slowly until such time as his finances were in a healthier position he began by turning to private finance in less than a month he had managed to raise the equivalent of 1.5 billion francs in the form of various credits i had to go look into the footnotes to be like okay well who's giving him the money one institution is credit leon a the other is jp morgan and then they also manage jp morgan and a group of eight international banks and then he does something that he wouldn't do later in his career he laid his cards on the table in an interview he declared in the current economic climate the stock exchange is at its lowest there will be opportunities to seize both in luxury goods and distribution the key is to make the right choice and skillfully to apply rational methods he could say all this more easily as he had battle funds of around six billion francs when there was a talk of a possible takeover bid for the group this is lvmh right there was talks of a possible takeover bid for the for the group lvmh but nobody then imagined that bernardo nalt could have been a been a possible predator especially on re racamir who went and sought him out in hopes of ousting his partner allen cheviller our knoll had come to racamir's notice it appeared on all had the same approach to the world of luxury luxury goods bernard's young age check this out bernard's young age was a decisive factor in racamir's decision he could not become a rival he thought why did he think he couldn't become a rival because i'm a 76 year old unbelievably successful person this is 35 bernard's 35 yeah he's sharp maybe we can get him to succeed in like five and he can run the company like five 10 years and this is where bernard's like nope i'm coming for everything and then let's go back to this main theme bad boys move in silence these meetings that are happening between racamir and our knoll are taking place in great secrecy guess what our knoll's also going to have secret meetings with racamir's partner that he hates that he's trying to get out too so the book goes into great detail about this i'm just going to give you the punch lines here because it's so it's like almost too much detail especially what bernard's here bernard's doing very skillfully he's playing everyone else off of each other he knows that they hate each other they both of them now he's had meetings with both of them they both think they're his ally and so he says racamir was still counting on bernard to overcome chevillier chevillier was convinced that he had found that in bernard he had found himself the support necessary to neutralize racamir see this like this goes back to like why i said it was so important to understand the discontent between the two co-founders of lvmh and how it opened the door for bernard this was a skillful setup everyone believed that they owed him something nobody yet suspected the true designs of this young man and so these events that i'm describing this is july 1988 remember he doesn't get control until the next year he does not have full control yet as of july 29th 1988 he owns about 27 he needs more money to continue his advance so what does he do when he needs more money he goes back to that setup that russian doll cascade setup that antoine taught him to follow up on his attack he needed money he therefore reorganized part of his empire according to a well-tried technique in order to raise capital a partial sale of the dior company until then dior couture was held 100 through bozak immediately he transformed dior couture into a holding company allocated its stake in lvmh and offered the capital to the holding company and and offered the capital of the holding company to private investors why did he do that because this brought bernard 3.3 billion francs money he's going to use to buy more shares of lvmh and so eventually racamir realizes oh no he switched sides and he realized oh like this part i thought i had a partner and now he actually he's my predator and so this is when it gets unbelievably complex i could read this section 10 times and i probably still wouldn't understand it completely the main idea that jumped out the one that i want to remember is the fact that bernard remember he he gets in when there's this huge crash that's his first the uh when he starts first accumulating shares now there's so much buying and that's having a secret he's raising so much money to buy stock that the the stock price is soaring and this is the main part that that jumped out to me bernard believed in his plan so much that he kept buying even at record prices and what's crazy is his his adversaries see the jump up in price and they sell and they sell because it's a record price and so what i thought is like okay well what are those shares worth today what at the time this is like how crazy this at the time it looked expensive what looked expensive was actually unbelievably cheap and no one saw it but our null so it says at 1 pm uh our null attacked the shares soared to 4720 francs remember he he bought in started buying in what like 1250 it said this was a record level faced with this explosion in the price racamir a good financier lightened his portfolio of lvmh shares 80 000 shares were sold who do you think bought it our null continued buying in two sessions on january 5th and 6 he managed to buy up 800 000 shares eight percent of the of the existing lvmh shares by friday january 6 at 6 pm it was clear an lvmh board meeting was called in the corridor chevalier met bernard on all a good sport he told him i played i lost i'm resigning there's the line i mentioned earlier only killers survive bernard on all had won six months had been enough for him to reach the helm of the most expensive company in france the following day he would be sworn in as the chairman of lvmh that is the last line in a chapter called conquest the next chapter is called the terror remember he is 40 he is 40 years old and now it picks up where we started the book at i am the boss i shall be here on monday morning and i should be running the company in person there will be no power vacuum now he had to deal with the aftermath and let it known this is about the dictator right now he had to deal with the aftermath and let it be known that the group was managed by a single person and what's remarkable about reading these old books older books right and you see a snapshot in time he calls his shot he's 40 when he says this and over the next 30 something years he this is exactly what he does arnold said he wanted to make lvmh the biggest luxury goods group in the world he said that at 40 and so even though bernard is unanimous chairman right he's got to fight for like another year and a half something like that because rackemeyer is refusing to give up he's believed in perseverance he says if he had to fight he would fight to the end he would not let this youngster how many things they've used that word describing like three times in the books tell us he would not let this youngster whom he had imprudently introduced into the group take from him his company his wife's company and that of his in-laws a company it had taken 10 years to rebuild the aggressiveness of this young man surprised him he had been wrong about bernard this is very fascinating he'd when they closed the first deal they did he had a premonition that maybe he was wrong and this is he wound up being proven right you know six or nine months later he had been wrong about bernard he said that he had a premonition when i signed the alliance packs packed with him in june 1988 i held on my hand it was like holding a limp rag i felt a gut reaction telling me that i had been wrong but the die was cast afterwards i rationalized it when i got to that section it made me think of one of my favorite quotes from steve jobs he said intuition steve just had this towards the end of his career intuition is a very powerful thing more powerful than intellect in my opinion that's had a big impact on my work and now if you do not mind i would like to make one more comparison to rockefeller rockefeller did not it's not particularly enthusiastic about the oil the burgeoning oil industry right he just saw that as his best opportunity to make a lot of money he wanted to make a ton of money because he thought like god gave he's giving him his power he's his job is to make as much money as possible and give it away and he also saw an industry that was growing and he could kind of like impose his will on i think that's how bernard saw the luxury industry although it's a lot more glamorous than like refining oil like uh was you know in the 1800s but listen to how he talks friends were amazed by this person who presided over the destiny of so many luxury brands the only area in which french products could not be competed with for bernard had understood before anyone else that it was a true industry that sounds exactly like rockefeller for bernard had understood before anyone else that it was a true industry to his friends who said he was in love with the luxury good industry bernard replied not at all you cannot explain love my relationship to luxury goods is really very rational it is the only area in which it is possible to make luxury profit margins he's still having this fight with rockamere i just want to point out this is exactly what rockefeller was called as well rockamere starts insulting bernard in the plot in the press so at one of their meetings he approaches rockamere in the hallway and he says you made a libelous attack on me by calling me a bandit and a gangster that's how rockefeller was described in his day that rock rockamere's uh response here was actually kind of funny i made no attack i just made an objective statement and so even though he made a bunch of um errors like first merging with uh moat hennessey and then inviting bernard in he you gotta like this old guy like here's uh here's an example like he just refuses to give up like until he's forced to give up so they're both realizing that both is more powerful than the other one thought this old gentleman never gave in worse still he gave the impression of backing down so as to counterattack better he liked to fight and in return rockamere perfectly identified now he you know he over underestimated his opponent didn't really understand who he was now dealing with him he goes oh uh bernard wants to take power everywhere and immediately that's a great quote bernard wants to take power everywhere and immediately and so then i need to pull out something that was fascinating so in the business breakdown episodes talks about like they're talking about bernard now right and through like his track record he's got 30 years of track record that is not in this book and he says that one thing that bernard did back then and still does to this day which is very valuable that he targets timeless brands that have proven themselves in different economic cycles and through changes in consumer preferences even though lvmh may be 30 40 years old whatever it is some of their brands are hundreds of years old so this idea of like let's target and you see that he did this i'm i'm i'm taking the quote from the business breakdown episode and tying into where we're in the book the young bernard knew that he was going to do this so he's got to target timeless brands that are proving themselves in different economic cycles and through changes in consumer preferences why because they are durable and how do we know that because time is the best filter let's go to a young 40 year old bernard saying no no i know what i own is rare and it will increase in value over time my 10-year objective is that lvmh's leading position in the world will be further strengthened in the luxury goods sector i believe that there will be fewer and fewer brand names capable of retaining a worldwide presence and that those of our group will be among them my plan for the next six months so this is 10-year objective my plan for the next six months is to see all the group managers of the businesses and increase their motivation that's a nice way of saying he's going to be on their ass right my plan for the next six months is to see all the group managers and increase their motivation by sharing my highly ambitious objectives with them back to another idea that we've seen over and over again bernard all-nol is intolerant of slowness his relative youth emphasized his impatience his goal was to still make his mark in the business world fast reaching the age of 40 encouraged him in this direction and so eventually bernard wins he gets racamir out of there and then there's a great description of a young bernard by a journalist he makes the cover of a french magazine no one has any illusions left about this ambitious young financier who has shown no compunction in removing the man who had introduced him into the lvmh fold those who were naive enough to see bernard rise as a succession of lucky accidents had understood nothing of the man or his technique the text was illustrated by a cartoon a man with a wolf's head and another another comparison with rockefeller talks about finally he has complete control says he devoted himself to running the world's leading luxury good company his investments had been costly 11 billion francs he had to get out of debt and most importantly build up his war chest again if you study the early history or the early career of rockefeller he had no compunction about going deep into debt and using the money raised to monopolize his industry and have complete control over not only standard oil but the entire oil refining market and so the book ends with bernard in complete control and the author is wondering what is next but will he be content with having achieved what he set out to achieve he is after all only 42 by the time i'm 70 i'll retired long since he says was he to be believed we know from our vantage point hell no right he had worked from the time he was a child and he had never stopped working his father had never had to tell him to study that was all that he had ever done at all events he had determination and he never gave up the willpower forged by the strict upbringing he had received meant that he lived a lonely life setting him apart from other members of his generation he was not like other people even at the age of 19 he was different just like rockefeller in may 1968 when all of his fellow students had taken to the streets and were on protest march marches his single concern was that his lectures would be canceled he thought only about one thing passing his exams this solitude was to be his constant companion he was never wholly to trust anyone apart from his father he kept his joys and his sorrows to himself rockefeller he was impassive whatever the circumstances what did he think of other people it was exceedingly difficult to tell he showed nothing of his feelings he did not care much for fancy social events which he felt were a waste of time the parties that he threw to celebrate dior's 40th anniversary for example were extremely lavish affairs this was not ostentation it was work you had to make people like you but how his strength lay elsewhere his success was founded on what could almost be called a napoleonic strategy select the right target attack the enemy at the right time and in his weakest spot and leave nothing to chance in the ensuing battle racameer is an iron fist in a velvet glove arnall is an iron fist in an iron glove if arnall has a religion it is efficiency so much so that people no longer dare invite him to lunch for fear of meeting with the have we anything left to say to each other line that he has passed into legend each moment counts he does not compromise he overturns everything in his path it is totally foreign to his nature to compromise his beliefs he relies on no one but himself and does not want to be in anyone's debt above all he has to be in control of events it is not surprising that the only man who truly fascinates him is giovanni and genele the chairman of fiat embodies both the supremely successful industrialists and unequaled power that in arnall's eyes is what it is all about politics is ephemeral companies have a durability which guarantee the only real power worth having and bernard all know has a taste for power and luxury they knew all this about bernard on all when he was 42 is it a surprise that 30 years later he built one of the most successful businesses in the world that is 296 books down 1000 ago and i'll talk to you again soon
