This book is about philosophy. It's about ethos beliefs and all those things which gentlemen love to yap about if it's any consolation Though this book is also about sex as it's written primarily to address a rather awkward question Can a two billion dollar gorilla like Ogilvy ever be svelte sultry and sexy again? The Ogilvy agency of the 1950s and 1960s was far hotter than WK CB These are all these other competitors that they're listing at the time and the rest of them combined The question is can we still be gorgeous now that we're several hundred pounds heavier? The answer to our dilemma can be summed up in two pithy words divine discontent Decades before advertising profits were preaching good enough and good enough Ogilvy was already practicing it But what did David actually mean by divine discontent? Here's an interpretation Don't bow your head. Don't know your place Defy the gods don't sit back. Don't give in don't give up don't win silver medals Don't be so easily happy with yourself. Don't be spineless. Don't be gutless. Don't be toadies Don't go gentle into that good night and don't ever ever allow a single scrap of rubbish out of this agency This handbook will tell us how to make David's divine discontent a habit by the daily practice of the following creative habits That was an excerpt from the book. I'm going to talk to you about today, which is the internal pursuit of unhappiness The subtitle is being very good is no good You have to be very very very very good and is written by the team at Ogilvy and Mather and David Ogilvy Before jumping back into the book, I'm gonna tell you how this unexpected episode came about I've been spending the last like week and a half deep in study on one of my favorite filmmakers I'm making an episode on them right now. It's Quentin Tarantino I get to the end of the book on Tarantino the epilogue of that book blew my mind I'm sitting on my desk I put the book down and on my desk to the left of my computer monitor has been this book I've read this book the eternal pursuit of unhappiness and you can't even really call it a book. It's 65 pages You can read it I don't know in an hour and for some reason I decided to pick it back up and then I just in one sitting Read through the book again And even though I read it before and I'm obsessed with David Ogilvy I consider him one of my personal heroes and I didn't even know who he was Until I read Warren Buffett's shareholder letters and he kept referring to Ogilvy as a genius and so I was like I gotta find out who this guy is and so I bought every book that I could find on him and then Somebody actually told me they're like, I'm sure you have every book But are you gonna do an episode on the eternal pursuit of unhappiness? I was like, what is that? So months ago I wind up buying this book. So anyways long story short, I had this idea in my mind It's like oh, I like this book, but you know, I can't ever do an episode on it You know, it's it's too small and for some reason after I read it this time I thought of an idea I learned a long time ago and this is probably because a main story the next episode will be obviously on Quentin Tarantino and what's remarkable about reading this book is you know, there's all these ideas that Tarantino is finding in like the 1970s that he doesn't use until like the early 2000s and I finished this book and I think of this this idea I learned about seven or probably seven years ago when I read Danny Meyer Danny Mars famous New York restaurateur and the founder of Shake Shack and in Danny's autobiography He's constantly coming up with like new ideas that no other restaurants have used before and he has this idea where he would prompt Himself with five words because people would say oh you can't do that Like you know restaurants done that before and so he would say whoever wrote the rule and then he would just say like whoever wrote The rule for example that you can't make a high-quality hot dog cart that it was actually the very first Version of what would come into Shake Shack Shake Shack is now You know four and a half billion dollar company today and started off as a hot dog cart in a park in New York City And so I realized by refusing to even attempt to do a podcast on this book that I was making up just fake rules Like whoever wrote the rule that the book has to be you know 300 pages for me or 100 pages or whatever it is for me to do an episode on so I'm gonna jump into this book It was written because it's trying to solve the problem It's like what do you do when you know the found it's not a founder led company anymore the founders passed away But we still want to use his ideas to create to craft a company culture to make sure we're doing the best job possible the job that David Ogilvy would be Proud of and it starts with this idea They kept referring to one of my favorite ideas that David Ogilvy had and he has this idea of divine Discontent and you find this in a lot of top performers and so he says we have a habit This is David Ogilvy speaking now. We have a habit of divine discontent with our performance It's an anecdote to smugness. So that idea is that you're always slightly Discontent with the quality of your work quality of your company You're always constantly trying to prove it Steve Jobs You'll see this over here over and over again and the people that you and I study Steve Jobs has a great quote on this I'm gonna paraphrase but he says something like, you know, what do you do when you do something wonderful? Like you just wake up the next day and try to do something wonderful again That is very similar to the idea that David is trying to teach us with divine discontent And so they come up with eight habits of highly creative communities and each short chapter is on one of these eight habits And so before I jump into the first chapter I just want to give you the overview that they give us to the ancient Greeks a good habit was called a virtue While a bad habit was known as a vice each of these eight habits has a corresponding evil twin While we work at adopting the eight creative virtues We have to work equally hard to replace the old patterns of self-defeating behaviors Because there's an old Latin proverb that tells us a nail is driven out by a nail a habit is overcome by another habit It is important to note that all these eight habits are required in all of our disciplines and are by no means Proprietary to just an advertising agency meaning it's applicable to any business any craft any discipline these eight habits belong to the whole church and so it gives you the virtues that they're trying to make sure that every single person up and down the organizational chart is using and The vices that they want you to avoid and how they and how they relate to each other So I'm gonna start with the vices right because that's a bad habit a habit that you're gonna see Recur more frequently than the good virtue that needs to replace it. So companies operate out of fear We do not want to operate a fear. We want to operate with courage companies optimize for expedience We want to optimize for idealism companies stick to the status quo. We want to be curious. Most companies are boring We want to be playful most companies have a tyranny of politeness, which means you just lie to each other We want to have a culture of candor most companies are run on cold arithmetic We are going to optimize for our intuition most companies fall into bureaucracy We want a culture of free spirit in us most people give in and we will persist So let's take these habits these cornerstones of good company culture in order habit Number one is courage under each habit at the beginning There's usually a short quote that illustrates the idea that they're going for this sounds like old movie, but it doesn't say it was old movie There's no shortage of brains in the industry It's the vertebrae column that tends to be missing when I read that made me immediately think of something I read in Peter teals book zero to one episode 278 if you haven't gone back I think this is the second or third time. I did an episode on that book Peter says it's very similar to what what they're saying right here about courage brilliant thinking is rare But courage is an even shorter supply than genius and The one vice that usually crowds out courage is fear so they start here I've been obsessed with dune and I love how the main character in dune Paul his mother is constantly Repeating this like Maxim or this affirmation to herself just fear is the mind-killer Fear is the mind-killer fear is a demon that devours the soul of a company it diminishes the quality of our imagination It dulls our appetite for adventure and it sucks away our youth Fear leads to self-doubt Which is the worst enemy of creativity when I got to that line thought of Arnold a young Arnold Schwarzenegger He said this when he was young he says when he's older when you start doubting yourself. That is very dangerous The team at old review says that fear is the enemy of creativity if fear is our principal adversary Then courage is our chief ally it is the first of the eight creative habits for a good reason It is the habit that guarantees all the others in the absence of courage nothing worthwhile Can be accomplished that's because anything on the cutting edge needs to be constantly fought for and defended Ideas are magical, but they're fragile seeds that require protecting we clearly need a spine And I love the use of the word we there right it's not we me and you it's we as a company our company needs a spine Only with the spine will we stop double guessing and express an opinion and that's very fascinating Because founders know that inherently right again the founder in this case has been dead I think 15 years by the time this book is written or something like that So it says you know only with the spine will we stop double double guessing and expressing an opinion That's not even I don't even think that needs to be said to a founder because a founders opinion is expressed in the product and company That they built one of my favorite ways to express that idea or the intent behind that idea Came from this random book one of the you know ten or eleven books or whatever it is that I've read in Steve Jobs And it says Apple is Steve Jobs with 10,000 lives You saw Steve's opinion in the products in the company that he built Only by standing up for what we believe in when we begin to build the most precious commodity in the world trust So trust with your customers trust with the team right then the virtuous cycle begins courage leads to trust which leads to courage which leads to trust and upwards and onwards we go that idea I didn't understand until this is like recently Maybe two months ago how important it was at least I didn't understand explicitly How important trust was and of course as usual Charlie Munger puts that idea into my mind better than almost anybody else Where he said that trust I talked about this on the episode 329 which is The new version the updated version of poor Charlie's almanac and he said trust is one of the greatest economic forces on earth And it's the trust that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger established with each other very early on that Provided the ground for which everything else that they did in the future was built upon in fact There's a great line about this I'm gonna read from poor Charlie's almanac and they talked about the very first time they ever met and it says during that dinner Charlie and Warren realized they they shared many ideas It also became evident to the others at the table that this was gonna be a two-way conversation There was like I think four or five other people and they quickly wound up leaving and Charlie and Warren talked all night as the evening Progressed the two young men Warren was 29 years old the time and Charlie was 35 Became engrossed in a wide-ranging dialogue covering many aspects of business finance and history Where where one was knowledgeable the other was just as excited to learn Warren was unenthusiastic about Charlie's continued practice of law That's candor right we're gonna talk about candor. Well, you just met somebody's like yeah the job that you have sucks You should do what I do how many people would do that He said that while law might be a good hobby for Charlie was far less promising business than what Warren was doing Warren's logic helped Charlie to decide to quit law practice at the earliest point He could afford to do so when Charlie returned to Los Angeles the conversations continued over the telephone and lengthy letters Sometimes as long as nine pages it was evident to both that they were meant to be in business together There was no this is the trust part, right? Then the last paragraph I'm gonna read to you from this there was no formal partnership or contractual relationship There was no formal partnership or contractual relationship The bond was created by a handshake and backed by two midwesterners who understood and respected the value of one's word Again trust is one of the greatest economic forces on earth quote from Charlie Munger habit number two idealism Love this quote under it. We are the people that we've been waiting for Helen Keller was asked by a journalist what she thought would be worse than being born blind She replied to have sight and no vision when our dreams are little we become little people our aspiration becomes Meeting the next quarter's target and not losing an account Remember that I'm pretty sure this book based on the way it was written was written for internal use only I think it's why it's so hard to find I paid like 80 or 90 dollars For my copy and when I looked at Amazon this morning There was only a handful and I think they started like 95 dollars each and they're worth every single penny go back to One of my favorite lines of poor Charlie's Dominic that he said yeah There's ideas worth billions and a $30 history book who cares if the book is $100 take one idea that you use in career The return is a thousand times that so it says, you know when our dreams are little we become little people What is a little little dream meeting next quarter's target and not losing an account? We're fear in another word. We're afraid We're not on we're playing defense We need to be on offense when we focus our life solely on making a buck It shows a poverty of ambition Here is David Olgave's take on the subject one of the my favorite things that David Olgave said tells an entire story here in 10 words Raise your sights blaze new trails compete with the immortals How great we become depends on the size of our dreams let's dream humongous dreams put on our overalls and go out there and build them and Remember the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world or the ones who do nice little Steve Jobs Reference that they added in their habit number three curiosity an endless trail of ideas floats in the ether You will only see them if you're curious What do most of us do in this dazzling Aladdin's cave It's like this is beautiful what they're referencing there is really made me think of D Hawk the founder of Visa he had this great line when he was much older man. He said that life is a magnificent Mysterious Odyssey to be experienced right? So that's very To me it relates to what the team at Ogilvy the team at Ogilvy is saying here Like what we're in this amazing wonderful world this dazzling Aladdin's cave and what do most of us do we close our eyes? He who and this is what they're gonna quote Einstein here He who no longer pauses to wonder and stand wrapped in all is good is dead his eyes are closed So how do we fix this for a start? We have to ask stupid questions like a six-year-old does once again Einstein has something to say on this matter. I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted He said I am only very very curious I'm gonna pause there one of my favorite episodes I've ever done is on a single episode written or a single essay rather Written by Paul Graham the essays called and the episode is called how to do great work It's episode 314 one of my favorite lines in one of my favorite essays There's also one of my favorite episodes right is this if you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work And the oracle had to reply with a single word my bet would be on curiosity When we lost the capacity to see the world and everything in it as new Unreasonable and something that should give rise to astonishment We have become dim-sighted and stooped with age Ray Kroc founder of McDonald's I love he's he's got a bunch of great quotes, which is hilarious His I read his autobiography twice the last episode I did on it's 293 if you want to check that out But Ray Kroc summed it up nicely when he said when you're green we grow when we're ripe We rot that is from a man who found his life's work when he was in his 50s Habit number four playfulness we are all born children the trick is to remain one that is a quote from Picasso David Ogilvy never entirely grew up He would heckle in meetings throw chocolate cakes at dinner parties and roll down grassy slopes in Brooke Brooks brothers suits He told us to develop our eccentricities while we're young so people would not think we've gone crazy as we've gotten older Like all creative people David knew that necessity may be the mother of invention But horseplay is most certainly the father in the 1960s the Los Angeles Times Asked David how he felt about people going to work in jeans and tennis shoes when the norm of the day was suit and tie for men And an address or suit for the ladies. This is what David told the paper I don't care if people come to work in their pajamas as long as they get the work out The day after the article appeared an entire department inside of Ogilvy and Mathers showed up in pajamas The office rocked with laughter David said make it fun to work at your company kill grimness with laughter Encourage exuberance and get rid of sad dogs who spread gloom When people aren't having any fun, they don't produce good work the idea behind what David Ogilvy is telling us there reminded me of An answer Kobe Bryant gave one time in an interview and he was asked like what is the quality? What is the one quality that all the great ones have regardless of discipline and he says without hesitation Kobe said it's love It's not rocket science to me man. The quality that we all share is that we love what we do We absolutely love it and it's a pure love. It's not the fame. It's not the money. It's not even the championships It's loving what we do and we do it all the time We study all the time and as a result the championships come Habit number five candor only dead fish go with the flow It's another great line our job requires us to be brutally honest and totally dedicated to the truth The tendency to be nice and avoid telling the truth is so omnipresent in human beings that it can properly be considered a characteristic of human nature David warned us about the tyranny of politeness again This is why I'm obsessed with David and this is why one of the reasons obsessed with them And I think it's why Buffett called him a genius. It's the way he's a He's the best writer I've ever read for the podcast by far and he has this way to brand ideas So not only they get immediately into your mind, but they stick in there You will remember them and he talks about this idea the tyranny of politeness. That is a great phrase David warned us about the tyranny of politeness and how we can be too agreeable for our own good if we avoid candor We destroy trust we only get a spark when the stone and the flint are moving in opposite directions And so I was thinking about this is like we only get a spark in the stone We only get a spark when the stone and flint are moving in opposite directions and I like oh we're talking about Conflict inner conflict there and the quote that came to my mind from there came all the way back from episode 180 This is from Jeff Bezos. I love it So Jeff said if I have to choose between agreement and conflict, I'll take conflict every time It always yields a better result I will take conflict every time it always yields a better result if I have to choose between agreement and conflict I'll take conflict every time that is advice from mr. Bezos to you and I have it number six intuition This is one of my favorite parts dreams premonitions gut feelings are all tempts by our unconscious to guide us We are wiser than we think and intuition is the art of listening to the guru within us All of our finest thoughts and best ideas are not the work of the logical mind but gifts from the unconscious Right in a world dominated by quarterly reports and numbers. It's logic that gets all the airtime But we are in the business of creativity and discovery again talking about intuition the power of intuition Steve jobs talked about this intuition is a very powerful very powerful thing He said more powerful than intellect in my opinion Intuition has had a big impact on my work. That is the end of Steve jobs quote on intuition Now we're gonna pick up what David Ogilvy had to say about the importance of using Intuition in managing your company and the talent within it David said managing isn't all beer and skittles I have come to the conclusion that the top man has one principal responsibility To provide an atmosphere in which creative mavericks can do useful work to be successful. You must out of necessity Accumulate a group of creative people. This probably means a fairly high percentage of high strong brilliant eccentric non-conformists Some of these agencies that he's competing with when he wrote this was say 1950s 1960s, right now He's a founder led agency. He is wiping the floor with a lot of these old agencies is taking business from them They're creating great work Why because some of these mammoth agencies are now being managed by second-generation? Caretakers who have floated to the top of their organizations because they were smooth contact men These kind of caretakers cannot create potent campaigns our business needs massive transfusions of talent and Talent is most likely to be found among non-conformist dissenters and rebels talent again that description More and much more likely he's not saying this but it's I think implied here Must more much more likely to be hired by a founder led company, right? Big companies are not hiring non-conformist dissenters and rebels and then the team in Ogilvy summarizes this chapter, which is great It's the cracked ones It is the cracked ones in other words that let light into the world Habit number seven free spiritedness rule number one. There are no rules rule number two Never forget rule number one The business of producing ideas is both tedious and terrifying Most companies fail to grasp the fragility of the idea generation process the notion that bureaucratic Sausage factories which they're talking about right, right? Ogilvy was talking about that's if you really think about what just happened right from from habit to habit right now He was essentially saying hey We're competing as the second generation caretakers a second generation caretaker is gonna turn into this bureaucratic sausage factory now Think about this they're writing this Where they're writing this entire book as a way to try to remind everybody in their organization in the company to avoid coming into that We no longer have the founder the founders no longer with us He's passed on but ideas are immortal and we can still use them We've got to figure out systems so we don't turn into what we just competed with and overcame The notion that bureaucratic sausage factories pumping out fodder for meetings will solve problems is ludicrous Bureaucracy has no place in an ideas company They just told you maintain free spirit in this and rule number one is there are no rules and rule number two is for Never forget rule number one step inside a free Spirited idea centric company and you'll notice that the air itself is different. So again, we call that great company culture That's not the word that David Ogilvy is gonna use He's gonna come up with his own term step inside a free spirited idea centric company and you'll notice that the air itself is different David called this atmosphere and atmosphere is permission to practice magic David made the management of these intangibles the principal responsibility of the top man of himself, right? Inside a company with atmosphere the people are not servants to the system. They are alchemists Let's define alchemists that is a person who transforms or creates something through a seemingly magical process What else is left to do but trust the people we work with and set them free? That brings us to habit number eight persistence This is how a problem solver goes to work dead ends cabin fevers blind spots zigzags U-turns roundabouts and loop-de-loops are all part of the creative process You see those who live by their wits go to work on roller coasters That's excellent. You see those who live by their wits go to work on roller coasters The ride is exhilarating but one has to have a stomach of titanium for starters You're never a hundred percent certain you'll ever get there and if you even get to your destination You sometimes wonder where you've ever bothered other times the scenery pleasantly surprises you Self-doubt comes with the territory and ignorance believe it or not is an asset Experience and knowledge make a sensible predictable and dull But if you don't know that you don't know you're ideally poised for a leap across a chasm So again, there's a million entrepreneurs. I'll tell you Hey if I knew how hard it was gonna be like they get to the other side of success right build a successful company Like if I knew how hard is gonna be there's no way in hell I would have tried so that's my interpretation of what they're saying here that that ignorance can be an asset because if you knew How difficult it was going into it? There's no way that you would actually have done it You open your eyes wide and you shut them again to see ooh It's a fabulous idea. You do not assume you look and you look and you look and you look and you look and you look And you look and you look they're writing this I'm not I'm not stuck on you know I'm not having an aneurysm here You look you look you look you look and you look you look at the clouds you look in the closet You look at the ceiling you look in libraries you look in magazines You look at old advertising magazines you look at the Bible you look in cinemas you look in art galleries You look at people you look at the edge of your desk you look in the mirror you look at your dreams You look for patterns you look for the tiniest similarities. You look for microscopic differences You look under every stone you look to heaven You look for bloody anything after all Discovery consists of seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what nobody else has thought You're not proud you beg you borrow you steal you build on other people's ideas Someone was once asked where do you get your ideas? He replied I don't they get me and you never give in never given never given never never never God is with those who persevere Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent before them obstacles vanish into thin air and mountains crumble into atoms Doggett determination is often the only trait that separates a moderately creative person from a highly creative one That's because great work is never done by temperamental geniuses, but by obstinate donkey men Now that is a chapter on persistence I love that line dog a determination is often the only trait that separates a moderately creative person from a highly creative one Again my still my number one all-time recommendation has not changed after 343 of these these books biographies autobiographies If you could only read one of them and shame on you if you only read one of them But if you only read one of them my number one recommendation would still be James Dyson's autobiography against the odds He's written two autobiographies the first they're both great The first one is my top recommendations episode 25 episode 200 episode 300 it'll be episode 400 It'll be episode 500 every hundred episodes. I'm gonna reread that book again and again make new episodes on it's so important And one of my favorite lines in that he says there is no such thing as a quantum leap There's only dogged persistence and in the end you make it look like a quantum leap This is the conclusion for this little handbook So you see the eight habits are really David Ogilvy's big ideal broken into practical bite-sized pieces they are predicated on the principle that it's impossible to improve our reputation before we improve ourselves and Meaningless to put our personality ahead of our character. We are what we repeatedly do We are where we repeatedly do is an Aristotle quote the reason I know that is because Steve jobs right before he died He said his favorite quote of all time Was that quote by Aristotle where he says we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit So we are repeatedly do our character is a composite of our habits They constantly daily express who we really are Only if we are eternally unhappy with compromise Only if we leave no room for excuses only when we show appropriate disdain for expedience and absolute respect for the work only when all of us resolve to relentlessly practice these eight habits on every job and Every project will we begin to prove that we are not Goliath, but a company of Davids never the end and That is the end of this excellent little book for the full story highly highly highly highly Recommend buying cop I'd buy it keep it a close keep it a desk keeping your nightstand read reread Constantly refer to it and it probably a good idea as you're building your own company culture to write a little book like this For everybody inside your company as well So if you want to buy the book and support the podcast at the same time I will leave a link down below the link is available in the show notes on your podcast player and at founders podcast calm That is 343 books down 1000 ago and I'll talk to you again soon Real quick before you go if you have access to founders notes already you now have a new feature waiting for you It is my favorite feature by far. It is out of private beta and now in public beta So every single person that has access to founders notes already has access to what I am calling sage I went to a bunch of different names, but someone who's actually in the private beta gave me the name I thought it was a better description of what I actually am building Because he says sage has two main definitions. The noun is a profoundly wise person This refers to someone with a deep understanding of life accumulated knowledge and sound judgment They are often looked to for guidance and advice and then the adjective is a why is somebody that's wise Discerning or prudent this describes someone who shows good judgment and makes well-considered decisions Another person said I should call it Charlie after Charlie Munger Which is hilarious because that is exactly who I think of when I hear the word sage In fact, when you when you log in you'll see that Charlie is the icon for the sage feature And as you might already know I was able to have dinner with Charlie Munger and for three hours I could ask him any question that I could imagine and he answered using his 99 years of life and business experience and a lot of his answers were based on the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of biographies of great people that he read and sage is like that it Automatically searches all of my highlights for every book that I've read for the podcast It searches every note that I've made on any book that I've read for the podcast and it searches every single Transcript for all the episodes which means that sage searches every word that I've ever uttered on the podcast to answer your question So to review this really quickly if you sign up for founders notes Which is the best way to support the podcast you get access to all my notes and highlights for every book all the transcripts For every episode you can search all notes highlights and transcript by keyword that gives you the ability to see how all the fish is Greatest entrepreneurs thought about the same topic like hiring patience obsession monopoly moat incentives for reality There's just some recent examples that have searched for myself But you can also read all my notes and highlights by book if you choose so You can also read all my notes and highlights on the highlight feed. Don't worry about remembering all this You're gonna welcome email after you sign up with all the ways that you can use founders notes But the highlight feed is like a smart Twitter feed So instead of the random ramblings of these crazy people online This feed is actually a constant stream of ideas and thoughts from history's greatest founders and it's presented to you in a random order I use this feature to remind myself of the in review like the past lessons that you and I have Talked about on the podcast but also to prompt new thoughts. It's like history's greatest founders talking directly to you every single day I've talked to multiple people that have replaced like reading the news in the morning and said they're just reading the highlights feed and they Like it a lot better and now in addition to all that you can have sage Read all the notes and highlights and transcripts for you and give you ideas That you can use in your work based on everything that I've ever covered on the podcast I will leave a list of some suggested questions that I and other people have been in the private data have been using our private Beta rather have been using and ones that produced excellent results over time I'm gonna collect the best prompts and questions So there'd be a section where you don't even have to type in your own question You can just review what other people are asking Which I found very helpful because people have been emailing them to me and then the main point that I'm trying to get across To you is what I'm trying to build here. It's like the North Star is over time I want founders notes to be this ever-increasing Giant valuable curriculum and tool that you can use your entire career With the goal of condensing and clarifying the collective knowledge of history's greatest founders You can't use the ideas that you learn on the podcast if you don't remember them and I think founders notes help you Helps you remember them So you can subscribe on an annual basis if you choose or you can do a one-time option Which means you get every note highlight transcript I have ever done and every note highlight and transcript I will ever do plus any new feature that I add as I add more notes highlights features The price will go up so make sure you sign up now and you can do that by going to founders notes calm That is founders with an S just like the podcast. So it's founders notes Founders notes calm. Thank you very much for your support. Thank you for listening and I'll talk to you again soon
