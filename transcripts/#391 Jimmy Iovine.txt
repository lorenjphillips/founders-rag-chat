Jimmy I've been spent his career working with the very best people we can people like John Lennon Bruce Springsteen Tom Petty Bono Dr. Dre Trent Reznor Eminem and Jimmy knew just like Steve Jobs new just like Jeff Bezos knew that you always bet on talent in fact Steve Jobs said that you must find the extraordinary people that a small group of a plus players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players and Jeff Bezos set the tone from his very first shareholder letter when he said that setting the bar high and approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of Amazon's success you must build a team that pursues the a plus players that is exactly what Jimmy I've been did and that is exactly what ramp did ramp is the presenting sponsor of this podcast and ramp has the most talented technical team in their industry becoming an engineer at ramp is nearly impossible in the last 12 months they have hired only point 23% of the people who

founders and CEOs I know I hear from people that listen to this podcast every day that have switched to ramp and have raved about the quality of the product make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today that is ramp.com I've been wanting to make an episode on Jimmy I've been for years if you ask me who would you most like to meet and have a conversation with he's towards the top of the list of people that I'd love to meet him a conversation with the four part documentary on his life in partnership with Dr. Dre it's called the defiant ones it's one of my favorite documentaries of all time I've watched it all the time I've probably seen it more than 10 times and there's certain parts and clips from it that I've seen over a hundred and what is fascinating to me is like if you go and search for the final ones you can read the description of the documentary and it would say something like the defiant ones tells of the unbreakable bond of trust and friendship between music legends Jimmy I've been and Dr. Dre to street smart men from different worlds who together defied traditional wisdom and transformed contemporary culture in the process yes it is undoubtedly about the life and the partnership of Jimmy I've been in Dr. Dre over multiple multiple decades but what I really think the defiant ones is about it is really a documentary about entrepreneurship so to make this episode for you I rewatched all the final ones and listen to every interview I could find by Jimmy and because there's no there's no biographies there's no autobiographies of Jimmy I've been yet I hope you I would love if you wrote an autobiography and so then what I did is took notes on all this combine this into one outline and that's what I want to talk to you about and just before we jump in it's like one of the reasons he's really special it's like he's one of these Jimmy's one of these super talented people that the general population probably don't really know they're most likely not familiar with him at all but the top people in his industry know and admire him going way back from like John Lennon Bruce Springsteen Tom Petty Dr. Dre Eminem David Geffen countless other music executives and so hopefully by the end of this you'll see why those people and me admire and study and learn from Jimmy I've been he's got two of my favorite ideas that I've ever heard which I'll point to point out to you as we go through this I want to start with the fact that he was born in Brooklyn and his dad when he graduated high school the plan was like his dad set him up and to get him a job at the docks so Jimmy's dad was a longshoreman these are the people that obviously move the cargo from the ships to the port and back and forth and Jimmy didn't want to be a longshoreman he actually does something Jimmy does something right from a very young age it's really smart that would actually make Charlie Munger proud Charlie Munger would always say invert always invert and so Jimmy says I was thinking not what I was going to do I was thinking what I wasn't going to do I wanted to do something that was special he did not want to have a normal life just having a normal job he admired his dad his dad was his best friend we'll talk a lot about that but he didn't want to be a longshoreman and he didn't have a lot of interest but one thing that he was interested in was something from a very young age is the fact that he would sit in his room and listen to music for hours he wouldn't just listen he would study it he says in the documentary that he would read the back of album covers and so his family at the time says that Jimmy has a skill that actually come in really handy later on in his life and career is that he was able to make you a super fan of whatever he was a fan of and at this time it was just the people the music that he was listening to so through a family member he winds up meeting this young talented singer songwriter named Ellie Greenwich and it was Ellie Greenwich who got him his first two jobs in the music business and really that's a stretch to say he was in the music business because his first job in the music business was sweeping up in the recording studio somehow he managed to get fired from that job she gets him another job in a recording studio this job comes with a 90 day trial period Jimmy gets fired on the 89th day and so he's walking home after getting fired he calls Ellie and he's crying and Ellie gets him another job this one she got him a job at what will become a famous recording studio called the record plant what I love about Jimmy's ability to tell stories he will talk about what happened you know outline his career and what happened to when he was younger and he'll tell you what the important lesson from that was and his point was like hey when you're in a position to help somebody you should help them if you feel they deserve help and they deserve a break you should do whatever you can to help them because he was really talking about Ellie what would have his life have been if the second time he got fired from a recording studio she decided not to try to help him get another job that one act by her change the entire trajectory of Jimmy's life and it winds up being his first big break because at the record plant is where he meets Roy Sackala Roy Sackala is a legendary engineer and producer winds up becoming Jimmy mentor Jimmy talks about this he says when I was younger I was scared to death I didn't know where my life was gonna go and then I met Roy Sackala and John Lennon and they gave me a shot and then I work with Bruce Springsteen and Patty Smith and that was my college education I felt freedom freedom from what I didn't know and one of the best things that Roy Sackala did a reason legendary engineer and producer he would teach you by working through you and so we're working through you means he would literally sit Jimmy down at the board and say hey hit that button push down that lover see how the sound changes when you do that now do this now when you do that do this at the same time by working through Jimmy it gave Jimmy a feel and I actually make a record he says Roy Roy gave me my skills and so Jimmy's first big break comes from answering phone he's gonna describe what's about to happen here later on as the first day of his life so he got a big break because Roy Sackala tells Jimmy on Easter Sunday and says hey I need you to come in and help out in the studio Jimmy's living at home with his family he comes from a very traditional you know New York Italian family and his mom's like you're crazy you can't go it's Easter Sunday but Jimmy said I'll do anything I will do anything to make this work he shows up to the studio and Roy tells him I just wanted to see if you come in it was a test in the studio with Roy Sackala on Easter Sunday was John Lennon and so almost overnight Jimmy goes from sweeping the floors to working the board with John Lennon and so on all these other interviews and all these other podcasts Jimmy tells these incredible John Lennon stories the interview that Jimmy I've been did with Rick Rubin a few years ago was the best podcast single podcast episode I heard all year and a lot of the stories that Jimmy tells about this period is just like taking this extremely serious doing whatever was was ever as necessary not to get thrown out of this remember he had already been fired two times before he says listen I was just like how do I not get thrown out of this room because I've been thrown out of a few rooms I was sweaty so I'm on being very very nervous how could you not be nervous John's a beetle for God's sake I'm sweaty how can I just overdo it how do I just serve how can I be of service I learned he talks about you know not only running the board setting up the mics make sure the sounds good he's like I learned how to make John Lennon's tea I got so good at making John Lennon's tea he wouldn't let anybody else make it I timed it exactly right the way I am about everything I was about that fucking tea and so it's another example of somebody further down the line more successful trying to help Jimmy says John Lennon would just give me a shot on anything and everything it wasn't because I was talented it's because he liked me and he felt he could trust me and so John is the person that's going to send Jimmy for the first time to California because John's gonna fly to California and work with this legendary producer named Phil Spector there's a bunch of crazy stories are about to happen here four decades later after I tell you stories four decades later Phil Spector is going to actually murder somebody and he's going to die in jail but one of the things I have to point out to you is one of the things that Jimmy talks about is one of my favorite ideas and I'll go over this with you is just like everybody feels fear if you're trying to do anything new if you're trying to be successful if you're trying to change the trajectory of your life you are going to feel fear you've got to be able to step forward when you feel that and I want to give you some background here John Lennon puts Jimmy I've been up at the Beverly Hills Hotel Jimmy I've been is 20 years old he had never been on a plane before he had never stayed at a hotel before and now he's going to find himself in a room and have to figure out a way to help two of the most well known people in the music business and this is where he just tells crazy stories so he sets everything up it's very difficult to get the sound exactly right Phil Spector shows up at the studio Jimmy's already been there you know for hours and hours and hours and Phil Spector walks into the studio he's wearing a white butcher coat and he's got two guns strapped to his chest remember this is a guy who four decades later is going to murder a woman at his house and die in prison and so Jimmy is telling a story remembers 20 years old has no experience has a lot of fear has a lot of insecurity he said it was complete chaos Phil was yelling at people he was calling share a whore share was in there singing backup there was alcohol gallons of alcohol they're drinking the whole time Phil Spector is yelling at everybody and it's crazy we have to record for three weeks like that one day Phil comes in goes to the bathroom in the recording studio and starts shooting the bathroom up another day David Geffen shows up at the studio at this point David Geffen is dating share so 20 year old Jimmy I've been us no experience a lot of fear a lot of insecurity finds himself in a tiny tiny room and he's got David Geffen behind him and Phil Spector next to him and Phil is drunk and chaotic and yelling and so he tries to start yelling at David Geffen and this is the way Jimmy tells the story Phil is yelling at David so David says something very David David says I don't know about you but right now I have the number three four five seven and eight top songs in the country this induces Phil into a state of rage and Phil decides to try to attack him physically says Phil jumps into a karate stance which made me laugh and what also made me laugh is Jimmy's interpretation this remember Jimmy's from Brooklyn he grew up on a rough neighborhood and now he's around all these famous and really successful people and he goes oh these people do this too this is stuff I see back in Brooklyn and so the main point here and what I really thought about as he's telling these stories and I was watching documentary listening to these interviews like imagine being this young kid you have to work through this you have to work all this you're in a very turbulent environment and you know if you fuck this up it's not like you're going to get another chance and so that leads me to one of the two favorite ideas of Jimmy I mean I mentioned earlier in the fact that you need to use fear as a tailwind this is what Jimmy says fears a powerful thing it's got a lot of firepower if you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather to stand in front of you that's very powerful I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy just to do as well as the next guy and to do better than the next guy I had to just kill it that is still with me and how I work I just go in and he would say over and over again you have to train yourself that anytime you feel fear you have to take a step forward and I think one of the most important things definitely you know Jimmy talks about this over and over again it's like one of the most important and influential relationships he has in his life is with his father and I absolutely love what Jimmy's father did for him his father gave Jimmy confidence and this is what he said about his father my father was a real cheerleader he always told me whatever room you go into is better because you are there so I never felt no one wants me here or I don't belong I think that's really important because Jimmy said in another interview that when he was younger like I had a lot of insecurities and a lot of fear I was one of those guys like oh man I hope they don't hit the ball to me and so he gets to work with Bruce Springsteen there is so many great ideas that he learns from Bruce but I think the two most important ones is the fact that he this for the first time in his life he sees what a real work ethic looks like says over and over again I learned my work ethic from Bruce and then the second most important thing that comes out of this is the fact that they become lifelong friends this is like 1975 or something like this I think Bruce is like 80 now Jimmy's in his 70s and they're still friends and so the way I think about what Jimmy is about to witness here is I can summarize this in one of my favorite maxims mediocrity is always invisible until passion shows up and exposes it Jimmy says Bruce Springsteen taught me a work ethic Bruce taught me that you don't stop until you get it right Bruce's parts in the documentary about this time are some of my favorite ones this is a bunch of quotes I want to read to you he says if you want to accomplish what hasn't been accomplished before you have to be relentlessly and unapologetically determined you had two kinds of guys that we ran into at that time they're the kind of guys that wanted to go home at five o'clock and their interest and what you were doing didn't exceed the normal day for them and those guys never lasted because when you're trying to push the boundaries on things and when you're trying to move into different types of frontiers you need to be surrounded by people who really believe in what you're doing damn it that is such a good point and a great quote if you're trying to do something new if you're trying to push the boundaries I would say if you're trying to live up to your potential to fulfill your potential you need to be surrounded by people who believe in what you're doing he continues we were just very very determined if you were new to our club the relentless pursuit of our idea would have exhausted you it was simply understood that you were there because you believed what we were doing was worth it and so all these people are talking about what it was like working with with Bruce back then and he says that Bruce would simply lose track of time Bruce said we spent three weeks trying to get drum sounds right which is indulgent but sometimes you need to be indulged Jimmy talks about this that Bruce would stand over him and say one word over and over again dick stick stick and we're talking about what springsteen meant by that is like hit it again the drum was not producing what he called size and power it is producing the wrong sound it is not good enough so do it again for three straight weeks and then Jimmy has this great quote from Bruce Springsteen there's there's quotes for sometimes where a person reveals their inner belief and they can do it in a sentence or handful sentences you immediately understand who that person is and this quote is the most important quote for me it's the reason why next to me is this giant book that I'm going to read which is springsteen's autobiography called born to run I heard Jimmy say this quote that he heard from springsteen and I immediately ordered the book this is what Jimmy said Bruce said something brilliant he said I didn't want to be rich I didn't want to be famous I didn't even want to be happy I wanted to be great do you have any ideas how many of the founders that you and I have studied on this podcast that that applies to and so I went through Bruce Springsteen's autobiography and I wanted to see all the mentions of Jimmy I've been in springsteen's autobiography and I found this excellent quote on what Jimmy I've been was like at this time in their life and Bruce writes this line almost like he's writing a song Jimmy I've been brilliant imposter young studio dog with the fastest learning curve I've ever seen so Bruce is applying relentless pressure on top of a young Jimmy I mean he says Jimmy would fall asleep at the soundboard he was under so much pressure and so sleep deprived he almost quit and then Bruce's manager gave Jimmy some of the most important advice this is when Jimmy thought he couldn't take it anymore and he tried to quit and Jimmy said this is one of the most important things that anybody ever told him he said Jimmy stay in the fucking saddle you are missing the big picture what are we here for we are here to help Bruce make the best record he can that's the job we're not here to make you happy we're not here to make me happy we're here to contribute to Bruce's project and it is Bruce's project if you go back in there and you say to Bruce I am here to support you this is not about me it's about the album you will have a friend for the rest of your life and you'll have learned a lesson that is the big picture the idea to always stay focused on the big picture is the piece of advice that Jimmy would repeat and it applied for the rest of his career this is Jimmy's key takeaway from that advice in this experience he said you were there to help make their project better and part of that is caring as much about their music as they do I just said if these people are allowing me in this room I'm going to do as much as I can to be of service to them that's what it was built on it's funny some of the best investors I know actually speak exactly like this and how they view the founders they work with in fact I was talking to Josh Kushner at Thrive and he said almost this exact same thing to me I'm going to read this back it's really his view or my interpretation of his view of the founders that he works for you're there to help make their project better and part of that is caring as much about their music as they do I just said if these people are allowing me in this room I'm going to do as much as I can to be of service to them that is what it is built on and so Jimmy doesn't quit Jimmy goes back in that room he helps Bruce do whatever he can to make the best album he possibly can and the result the album they were working on is Bruce's album Born to Run which goes on to be a massive success and to this day which I think the album has been out probably for 50 years if you go and look at any list of the top 100 top 500 greatest albums ever made Born to Run is on those lists and so Jimmy's life changes now he's like oh I want to work with the same guy that worked on Born to Run and Jimmy talks about the fact that this success can be one of the most dangerous things that can happen to you he says you have success and you start feeling yourself he says I call this breathing your own exhaust the maximum I have for this breathing your own exhaust is a great one but if you go to sleep on a win you'll wake up with a loss stick to the routine stick to what got you there what was great was that they locked themselves in a studio and didn't leave until it was perfect and so Jimmy talks about making mistakes at this point in his life he's like oh like I got hired by this band called Fog Hat and you know he goes I wasn't good at my job yet I didn't understand he goes I brought my girlfriend to some of the sessions so he starts living the lifestyle not realizing that that's not what it is it's the work it's the routine and so he winds up getting fired off that project and then he said has this great line about this which is also another great idea just a lot of like you know he's a college dropout kind of from the streets of Brooklyn but he's got so much wisdom about he just has a fundamental understanding of you know human nature and how to to add value to other people and how to be successful and he says you know he got fired he he was on like the top of the mountain right it's like we just did border run now my next project I got fired now I'm down in the valley and he says I was embarrassed you think everyone else is paying attention to your life and they aren't it's complete bullshit and it was one of the most important things that happened to him because what does he do he recommits he's like I'm not gonna go sleep on a win and wake up a loss I'm not gonna breathe my own exhaust I'm gonna get back to what made me successful and so he starts working with this artist named Patti Smith and she's describing working with him at this point in his life Jimmy worked all the time he would stay for hours he'd study he thought this is such a genius idea he would this is his form of professional research and practice Jimmy would find old tapes and see if he could improve them I'm gonna take a song from 10 or 20 years ago and see if I can actually reproduce it and make it even better and this is what Jimmy said at this point in sight I said to myself no fun no life no nothing you are giving up everything you will put a hundred percent into this Jimmy's life I like this by the way with whatever he does this is another reason why I find him so fascinating and why he's one of the people I most admire and keep in mind he likes to pivot he'll talk about this like you know record producer then starting a record company then launching businesses with his artists like he does not want to do the same thing forever but whatever he's into he's into it 100% and so this is the result of him recommitting he winds up having this massive top 10 hit so Patti Smith is gonna do this song called Because the Night that wouldn't have happened without Jimmy because Jimmy got that song from Bruce Springsteen so Bruce Springsteen would write all of these songs and never use them Bruce was prolific and being prolific is highly correlated with greatness just because you're prolific won't mean you're gonna be great but if you're great it's highly likely that you've been prolific too and in fact I got one of the greatest examples of this recently Daniel Eck who's the founder of Spotify actually sent me this excerpt on Prince let me read it to you says in 1983 Prince walked off the stage at Madison Square Garden to a roaring crowd most artists would celebrate Prince went straight to the studio recorded until sunrise slept for an hour then called his band and said let's do it again that wasn't a one-off Prince worked like that for decades he wrote a song a day played every instrument produced every track and released 39 albums while others chased hits he stockpiled greatness by the time he died his vault held over 8,000 released songs enough for a new album every year for the next century Prince didn't just master music he let it consume him that's what made him immortal and so Bruce Springsteen was like that too Bruce talks about Jimmy I've been convincing him to give one of his songs to Patti Smith this is what Bruce said there is the talent of Jimmy I've been he eases in and he greases the wheels so things happen at a certain moment and Jimmy I've been works his magic Bruce gives the song to Jimmy Jimmy gives the song to Patti Smith Patti Smith writes more lyrics to it called because I actually went through I also went back and every time they mentioned some of these songs they made I went list to songs like 50 years old still sounds great and becomes this massive hit and then I loved Patti talking about what it was like working with Jimmy again going back to it's an act of service I am there to make your project better I'm there to do whatever I can to help you you know if it means states being stuck in the in the in the studio for three weeks hearing Bruce Springsteen say stick stick stick it means making John Lennon's tea it doesn't matter there's no ego involved I'll do whatever it takes to win so Patti Smith on working with Jimmy I've been it wasn't that Jimmy wanted to be the number one guy he was ambitious for you he was ambitious for me you always felt that his whole goal was for the world to see what he was seeing this another great interview and talks about just the the sheer amount of time that Jimmy would invest into his artist says you're notorious for phone calls and long phone conversations with your artist what was the significance of that and so they were record record all day and usually into the night and then they talk for hours and Jimmy says as a producer you have a responsibility to understand the person's record you're making to understand what they're trying to get out I would spend a lot of time on the phone after the sessions I would spend a lot of time just talking to them that again that's another piece of just very simple and profound wisdom take some interest in other people it takes time to deeply understand anything people are no different and so now another example of opportunity handle weld unlocks more opportunity Tom Petty wants to work with them and so Tom Petty does a great job in the documentary and he gives us a lot of good insight into what Jimmy I've been like and what it's like work with him he's like listen Jimmy is very very convincing he's very very persuasive is what Tom said and he says he's also obsessed and so another reoccurring theme that this advice that Jimmy gives out and I think you know obviously said part of the way he learned this is through Bruce Bruce Springsteen it's just like you don't just record a song once you don't just do it five times you do it 100 you do it 200 times he later on works with Bono and you too I think they're they said in the documentary like one track they recorded 250 times and so Tom Petty says Jimmy became so obsessed with getting the right take on a song that we did over 100 takes I think we should do more Jimmy repeat let's do more and so two of the songs they make are the songs called here comes my girl and refugee and this is hilarious since this is Jimmy talking now Tom played me the songs here come my girl and refugee I looked at Tom and said get another eight songs quick because we're done we're going to be millionaires Tom thought Tom thought that was such a strange thing to say about a song and then one thing they notice is it's not just creating the work Jimmy was also really good at marketing one of the best marketers I've ever come across they call him a tornado of promotion he wanted to have influence he wanted to have control on marketing because he says the problem is you'd come to these these record executives and you'd play them like the new Tom Petty song or the new Bruce Springsteen song and they would just say the dumbest shit they're like yeah that doesn't really sound like your last record and hearing that in the documentary this induces Jimmy into a state of rage he goes and Jimmy would say of course it doesn't sound like the last record it's not supposed to sound like the last record the whole concept is to not sound like anybody else Jimmy just didn't want to make a song like everybody else in fact he has a great line he says great is success that that is the North Star make something great if you can do that then after that you can figure out how to get how to get exposed to more people but the first thing is great is success and that applies to not only the products and the songs that Jimmy wanted to work to work on and to make but it's who he wanted to work with Tom Petty just nailed it he also reveals what is one of Jimmy's what was one of Jimmy's superpowers he says one thing about Jimmy I've been is he's always known which people to hang around with that is spooky because Steve Jobs said literally the same thing about himself Steve Jobs said I think I've consistently figured out who the really smart people were to hang around with you must find extraordinary people and so one of the main things I take away from studying Jimmy is like you Jimmy work with the best you always bet on talent here over John Lennon and Springsteen Tom Petty Dr. Dre Eminem Trent Reznor he's gonna talk about this over and over again just to find the best people and then he just empowers them he talks about this like producing the producers is I think the way he puts us I'll get to this a little bit so but he's also you can see the learning machine remember Bruce Springsteen says guys got the goddamn fastest like learning curve anybody ever seen so he's like okay well what did I do last time I build a relationship Bruce Springsteen this guy's prolific he's writing all these songs not using I said hey this is a good song you're not using can I give it to Patti Smith Tom Petty same thing very prolific writes all these songs doesn't use you know not even half of them so he takes the idea that work with Patti Smith and he can bet where he convinces you know Bruce Springsteen to give one of the songs and he says he's starting to work with Stevie Nicks who was super famous I think she was in this bank called like Fleetwood Mac but now she went on her own and so Jimmy starts producing her records her her new solo album and he's also dating her at the same time and he realizes that Stevie has great songs but you should she doesn't have a single and he found a song that Tom Petty had that he wasn't using and this is gonna be the song called stop dragging my heart he convinces petty to give Stevie Nicks the song and perform on the record and Tom Petty has a hilarious has this hilarious description of of of Jimmy I've been sales pitch to him he's like give her give her the song and this is gonna buy you a house which again Tom thought was just like a weird thing to say about a song so that song stop dragging my heart around becomes a massive hit it goes to number one on the charts and I love what Jimmy says here but this time in his life and this is how I feel I've resonated with his story this is a great thing about you know you and I going over the stories all time it's like yeah we're learning about other people we're really seeing reflections of ourselves the same kind of ideas that resonate with them we see oh that resonates with me too and this is one of them he says I only knew one thing that every time I went back to the studio I felt better and my life would get better it was that simple this idea really resonates with me and I think you just think what we think just focus on making great product and that product should make somebody else's life better that's step one then you find a way to keep making a greater number of other people's lives better and your own life will get better automatically Jimmy I mean was fundamentally uncomfortable with anything else but being in the studio and part of this because he's one of the most relentlessly competitive people ever come across he's insanely driven in fact they said after this is Doug Morris on Jimmy says after everything is said and done Jimmy wants a win so he's super focused only wants to be in the studio how does a super focused workaholic meet so he winds up meeting which is gonna wind up being his first wife and his first wife this is actually really important part of the documentary and I'm gonna bring this up several times of like how do you have personal relationships with you know people like a Jimmy I've been or Dr. Dre or really any you know super driven workaholic somebody just like is chasing after some somebody is on something that's so important is on a mission that they have a hard time taking time away from that and we see this from the very first time Jimmy's gonna wind up being married to his wife for 25 years they have four kids unfortunately sends in divorce and there's a lot of lessons that'll that'll go over about that later but there's kind of an indication here and so his first wife says I met Jimmy at a party this is a paragraph this paragraph is a great summary of his personality I met Jimmy at a party he said if you give me your phone number and I remember it can I call you he called me ten times the next day for our first date he sent a limousine to pick me up inside were napkins with my name printed on them but he's not in the limo then I realized were on the way to his house to pick him up that should have been my first indication he doesn't want to wait for people and so Vicky is a model and a playboy playmate she's a TV host she's an attorney and as part of being a TV host she wants interviewing a young Bono at the very beginning of you too and she's like you need to meet my boyfriend Jimmy you guys work really well together and so this another one of Jimmy's superpowers is like he first goes and sees and hears about a young Bono and you too and so he says when I first saw a young Bono I realized he had the same thing that springsteam had he had the edge this identifying of the very best people to work with is really important why is this important is just what Jimmy said you're only as good as the artist that you're working with any producer who says I did this and I did that is full of shit 99% of what's going on in the studio is the artist and so at first Bono was a little resistant to Jimmy says their styles are just so vastly different and then Bono has this great description of him Jimmy happens to you he's like a virus and that takes over your organs and your brains he just knows this is going to work out well for both of you he chased us all around the world until we agreed to come to the studio with him he would not take no for an answer this sound familiar. This is the way he signs talent works on deals this way he dates it's the exact same thing there's a hilarious for some reason this pops my mind was like hey this guy would not take no for an answer this guy's chasing us all over the world till we signed with him we just started to work with them the founder of visa de hawk actually described his sales technique one time in this autobiography wrote and he said I held fast to the notion that until someone has repeatedly said no and adamantly refuses another word on the subject they are in the process of saying yes and don't know it. And so Jimmy starts working with Bono you just realize is oh they have a lot there's a lot that Bono and springsteen have in common they have this extreme work ethic and he said Bono and you to work like springsteen they just go. And on Bono's part he describes one of the benefits of working with Jimmy a great idea has a lot in common with a great melody and Jimmy's gift is the clear thought he hears the clear melody and applies that wherever he is. So he starts out as an 18 19 year old kid sweeping the floor in a recording studio we are now 12 now he's 31 years old so we're you know 12 13 years into his life he's had massive success and then the single worst day of his life occurs he says in 1984. I went with my father to his father's funeral the next morning I flew back to LA I get a phone call from my sister saying that my dad had a heart attack I rushed back to New York 6 weeks later my father's mother died. Two days after that my father died my father his mother and his father all died within 6 weeks the day that my father died was the worst day of my life it is still the worst day of my life we were very very close and I had no idea he was going to die. He was my best friend in the whole world he is still my best friend in the whole world. He's destroyed he's lost at the same time he loses his father he starts his own family winds up marrying Vicki they have their kid their first child and he realizes I need a pivot I can't do this anymore he's starting to love business more than producing and so Jimmy talks about this point in his life he says was focused and miserable. I was working 24 hours a day I never did anything other than work I didn't want to do anything other than work I wanted to stop producing records I was 18 years in and I was burnt out I didn't want to be out all night producing records and not see my kids and so Tom Petty who was good friends with him at this time. Jimmy's heart was in the business he had a calling his calling was to be a great businessman even though he was a great producer he was an even better entrepreneur. And that is exactly what happened and so we go back to this reoccurring theme in Jimmy's life seeking out people that are willing to help you willing to that are further down the line they're willing to teach you and reach back and help you so he sees that David Geffen. Sold his company and Jimmy has this great Jimmy's great observation he's a wait wait a minute wait a minute I think he does what I do but he just made all this fucking money. So I went to see David Geffen to seek his advice so I said to David hey I want to start a record company and Geffen told me you should do it there are a lot of record people a lot dumber than you are. Which I thought was hilarious but Jimmy's response I was like that's that was actually inspiring for him to tell me that and he says I've always been a fan of David we became friends and he just constantly stayed in my life and it helped me. David Geffen taught me the art of business in music I was going in not knowing anything about business and again this is what Geffen says about Jimmy. If people think you're serious right in your easy to understand they will help you John Lennon understood that Jimmy was serious Bruce Springsteen understood the Jimmy was serious Geffen sees the same exact thing he says my first impression of Jimmy was that he was a sponge he picked up everything he heard or saw that sounds exactly like. What Bruce Springsteen realized about Jimmy when he first met now we're just like you know 15 years or 18 years later so this is the big push this is when Jimmy decides to to found his own record label he's going to start in your scope records which is going to become one of the most successful record labels of all time. So after David Geffen sold his record company I think he sold it for like. 400 or 500 million something like that there was a ton of people realizing oh wait I need to start my own record label just like Jimmy had the same realization right and so Jimmy needed to find his edge and I thought what he his observation here is really really brilliant. What is the edge for Interscope going to be and so Jimmy says I didn't feel comfortable around executives I felt comfortable around artists and record producers producers know how to get the best out of artists so I found my niche I got to find great producers and all produce that. One of these is going to be Trent Reznor the lead person in this band nine inch nails so at the time nine inch nails was signed to an independent record label that they absolutely hated. They're having a lot of success so all these other major record labels are saying hey Trent will fund the lawsuit to get nine inch nails out of the contract and Jimmy didn't think that would work and said you have to act you should actually work on convincing the owner of the independent record label. To partner in this case what the partnership would look like is you're going to transfer that contract to Jimmy to so he could start working with them and the way that Jimmy did this was very interesting and I think is also talks about why he was so talented. He deliberately chose a different path so every day for a year starting at 6am Jimmy would call all the parties involved and work towards a solution and so as you're describing this in the documentary they cut to Bono and Bono says the phone is Jimmy's theater of war that is where he is deadly. His wife said that Jimmy just locked himself in the bathroom and didn't come out and was on the phone all day long she said that Jimmy had a red hot focus it was nuclear Jimmy wouldn't give up and then Jimmy describes this the main advantage he has besides thinking he was very empathetic and look from other people's perspective point of views. To figure out how like what they wanted and how can you reconcile all these different parties but he just said I can outlast anybody like I'm just it is a war of attrition by endurance we conquer I can outlast anybody and so they interview the person that had signed 9H nails the owner of the independent record company and he described why he agreed to go with Jimmy took a long time but why agreed he says Jimmy is really good at empathy at understanding the other person's motivation their primal their primal motivations their desires and their desires. What is going to move them and so he winds up getting the contract getting Trent Reznor 9H nails out of this and he was doing this for a year he just knew that Trent was super talented he had never even met Trent in person and this again just speaks to one I want to think the most fundamental superpowers of Jimmy. Like find the very best people work with work like hell to get them to partner with you to get your side and then what you do give them the keys and say go drive he does something he's very consistent with he repeats over and over again and I'll give you an example of this. So Jimmy goes to meet Trent Reznor let me pause let me go back because I think this is really important one again one of the most things I admire about Jimmy the clarity of thought unbelievably simple understanding of the most important thing a simple way to explain this you understand what's going on. So he just worked on this guy's deal for a year he understood and you really with all these these freaking geniuses these musicians these filmmakers entrepreneurs same thing they're obsessed with control and Jimmy just keeps it simple goes up to Trent and says what do you want. And Trent says I want you to give me an advance for an album and then just leave me alone and I'll give you the album and the singles and the artwork I have an idea please don't try to ruin it as it's trying to come out of me and Jimmy said okay what else do you want. And Trent said I want a record label where I could sign other bands if I felt like that and Jimmy said okay what else do you want and I couldn't think of anything else. And so from another interview Jimmy talks about this ecosystem I come from a place where the artists get to do exactly what they want and no compromise I'm not going to sit down there until to park or Trent Reznor want to change the lyrics or change this or change that that is a bunch of bullshit. When you have great artists when you have great talent what you do is you give them the keys and you say drive. And so at this point Jimmy's life he is now pivoted he does not want to produce records anymore he wants to. Make a successful record company and this is what I mean he just always keeps the main thing the main thing this is how they describe him at this time Jimmy had this mad obsessed focus on the big picture remember the advice he got 15 years ago when he almost quit on spring scene focus on the big picture. The big picture is we're going to make the best record label in the world and he had an actual like almost everybody you and I talk about he had and he had inspiration from somebody that did what he was doing but did it in the past so 20 years earlier he's like hey what I wanted to do is I wanted a record company in the spirit of Atlantic records in the 1970s. Back then they had Ray Charles Led Zeppelin Aretha Franklin and the Rolling Stones they those were the greatest artists of their time that is what we're trying to do what is he doing or just we need the best we're going to bet on talent and Bruce Frensing talks about this time in Jimmy's life people become successful. They get locked into the behaviors of letting to be a success Jimmy was very very good at letting go of what it might have made him a success to this point remember he could have just been a record producer for the rest of his life. He's willing to shed that and to go for something else he is not afraid to partner with other visionary people Jimmy's career is based on a tremendous lack of fear of moving forward. And then Jimmy has a meeting that changes his entire life Jimmy's going to describe for us the first time that he met Dr. Dre Dr. Dre comes into Jimmy's office to play his album The Chronic. The Chronic has not been released yet it would go down to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time and this is how Jimmy described it. It was one of the greatest recordings I'd ever heard Dre's music is not like anybody else's Dre's sonics were far superior to any rock or hip hop record being made it sounded better than anything else on my speakers so I asked Dre who produced this he said me. I said yeah but who engineered this he said me I'll never forget it I said this guy will define Interscope and I said to Shug he's Drazen this meeting with Jimmy with Shug night and Dr. Dre and so I said. To Shug night and Dr. Dre give me three weeks they had all these like lawsuits that were getting in the way of them releasing the music so he said so I said to Shug and Dre give me three weeks and I can clear up all these lawsuits if you guys fuck around and go to a bunch of different labels. I'm going to hear about it and I'm going to bounce but they kept their word this is the beginning of this three decade long maybe even longer now partnership that Dr. Dre and Jimmy I've been have now they're going to make some of the greatest music Interscope's going to be. Amazing success but obviously it culminates in them starting a company together because eventually gets tired of running a record label to each like I want to build businesses my artists they want to be selling that business for that's how to become billionaires. They sell it to like three for three billion to Apple but I want to go back to the early days of Interscope because we're still in the you know the early to mid 90s. And there's a lot of other startup record labels at the time and yet Interscope was an outlier and they they talk about like what some of the reasons that Interscope was successful versus like the other star record labels the time and he says Jimmy was an animal. The most driven and brilliant person at the same time he was never off and he didn't understand why everybody else wasn't the same way and Jimmy was remarkably consistent from the very first time when he's working with Bruce Springsteen John Lennon Tom Petty Patty Smith. Now when Stefan they sign Gwen Stefani no doubt and I forgot no doubts record on Interscope sold like 17 million copies or something that was just crazy but Gwen Stefani says that. The feedback from Jimmy was very very consistent right another song right another song right another song as an artist you think you're done and in his mind you're never done why why is he giving that advice 20 years later because he saw what Lennon did he saw Bruce Springsteen did he saw what Tom Petty did I'm sure he saw what Prince was doing. And he's also applying that relentlessness to his own craft of building the record label his first wife talks about this we knew that Jimmy's thing was going to be the thing that was going to change the world so it was worth it for me to make sacrifices this is Jimmy on building Interscope I was on a mission a very very intense mission. Let's go to another brilliant idea that Jimmy I've been had the fact that you should be optimizing for long term relationships there was so many people trying to screw over. Dr. Dre Jimmy could have been just another guy in the long line of people trying to screw him over hey I'm going to you know put him into a bad deal I'm going to make all this money on the chronic you know which is going to be obviously if you listen to it's going to be a great album but what you make a couple million dollars more by screwing over guy and then you lose out on that relationship the relationship that one your close friends and will make you billions and billions and billions of dollars 30 years into the future loyalty and long term relationships loyalty and long term relationships Jimmy finds his people and they just covers their back no matter what so when. Dr. Dre has a falling out with sugar night over death row record like I gotta get out of here man I like I want to start my own record label Jimmy me he goes cool let's do it what do you want to name it after math records okay done and so Dre is going to own 50% and Interscope is going to own 50% now talk about loyalty it's really easy to be loyal when everything's going right that's not what loyalty is loyalties like you're there when shit hits the fan so. Everybody this time is a trade one of the best producers you know putting out some of the greatest albums we've ever seen producing the greatest albums ever seen and yet the first two albums that Dre puts on his own record label for the first time the one that he owns he's not partners so I suppose Jimmy but he doesn't have like sugar anyway else. And they flop both records flop bad record sales means that Dre is in a lot of debt and now you have Jimmy's corporate partners through Interscope saying hey you need to get rid of this guy and so Jimmy says I was getting a lot of pressure corporately to get rid of Dre and I said yeah we could do that and then you'll save my salary as well because I'm going with him. And so at one of the lowest points in his career Jimmy helps Dre this is the maximum that opportunity is a strange beast it frequently appears after a loss. Dre didn't have an artist to work with he had no successful releases on his own label he didn't know what to do so Dre would go over to Jimmy's house and they'd have listening sessions Jimmy was trying to help Dre find an artist to work with go back to Jimmy's niche I'm going to produce the producers. So Jimmy throws in a tape Jimmy plays the tape and Dre says what the fuck and who the fuck is that the answer to that is Eminem it is a demo of Eminem that Eminem handed out at the rap Olympics to someone that worked for Jimmy. Think about this people are telling Jimmy to ditch Dr Dre because he had two projects fail ditch him right before Dre is going to help develop the artists that will go on to be the best selling rap artist of all time top 10 best selling of all musicians of all time. And so then Jimmy says one of the greatest things about this great can come from anywhere great can come from anywhere Eminem was growing up poor in a trailer park in Michigan and so Jimmy says we weren't looking for a white controversial rapper we were looking for great again. Jimmy is very consistent great go for great great talent great products great marketing and so Dre starts producing Eminem Eminem's first few albums are some of the best selling I think the best selling rap albums of all time. And he's getting all kinds of attention and he's saying a lot of controversial things and so he's getting boycotted there's pressure on Jimmy to like police the lyrics and yet even though throughout all this controversy the Eminem was getting into being his career Jimmy was consistent. He said let him be him and it is during this time that Jimmy describes why he said that that he says my second favorite idea of his so when I say that I've watched certain parts of this over 100 times the pushing through fear and using it as a tailwind instead of a headwind was the first one this is the second one. I feel like I should make a poster with this quote and hang it on the wall and this is what Jimmy said I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks when you're a racehorse the reason they put blinders on these things is because if you look at the horse on the left or the horse on the right you're going to miss a step. That's why those horses have fucking blinders on and that's what people should have when you're running after something you should not look left and right what is this person thing what is that person think no go. I clip that from the documentary spend my phone free as I just sit there and listen that over and over and over again one of the best ideas that I ever heard and the way he says it and the intensity in the passion is it's perfect. And so now he's going to pivot again he sees that the music industry is there's this unstoppable technological phenomenon. Gonna go from selling CDs to iTunes to eventually streaming he says something like you know I don't want to be the guy that sells the last CD and so his next pivot is. Hey I want to build businesses with my artists but at the same time this happens he gets divorced and I think this is actually one of the most important parts. For founders actually had dinner with a friend last night and a large part of our discussion was around this the tension that he feels. Between the focus and drive for his work and his wife not one essentially wanting him to be just just why can't you be more normal. And I think this part where Jimmy I've been ex-wife Vicky describes exactly what it's like to be married to people like this and she says look this is what we married. If you're gonna say I want an ordinary husband well then you can't marry a genius there's a lot of extremes because genius needs to feed itself. It needs to make its own hours it needs to not talk to you when it doesn't want to talk to you I didn't want to get a divorce until I did. And for Jimmy's part he owns up to this is after they were divorced that the interview had takes place after they were divorced he says I would imagine it'd be very hard to be married to me because I was so focused on what I was trying to accomplish. Is one of the most difficult parts of his life he says I was frustrated with music business I was frustrated with getting divorced and whenever I get sad or scared I wish I knew some other therapeutic ways of doing things. But the only thing I know how to do is completely bury myself to the point of absurdity in my work. Going back to what he said earlier in his career all I knew is that if I went to the studio my life got better and so he continues I wanted to build businesses with our artists I like to pivot I get complacent and bored. I got bored of producing records I got bored of running a record company and I wanted to move on that is how beats got started and so Jimmy actually goes to Dr. Dre's house in Malibu and Dre is telling him hey have this offer to endorse a pair of sneakers and Dre wasn't sure it made any sense he's like I don't know anything about fashion I wear the same thing every day and Dre was just very selective with anything he'd put his name on. But at this point he turned down dozens of endorsements and Jimmy's hearing him talk and he interrupts him he goes fuck sneakers you should do speakers speakers and headphones and then Dre says Jimmy immediately gets up and leaves a few days later. Jimmy calls Dre come to the office and Dre comes to the office there's a hundred different pairs of headphones with all different designs. So again I think this is like a microcosm of Jimmy's entire like his MO how he approaches work speed all in do more reps reoccurring themes in Jimmy's life and so this is also the marketing genius of Jimmy Iveen because he's talking about the positioning of the headphone market at the time. This doesn't make any sense the most popular one are Bose right and what are they they're noise canceling headphones and Jimmy says we don't want to put you to sleep we want to make you move we were looking at as motivation we want looked at as emotion we wanted to sell you something that would get you off your ass. And so Jimmy's idea for distribution is very simple simple if we get our headphones on the best musicians and then later they do the same thing for athletes that will cause people to try them and then the great sound will get them to stay again go back to that clarity of thought that Bono mentioned was obvious about Jimmy when he met him. And then Jimmy was absolutely relentless everywhere Jimmy went he would carry the headphones with them every single meeting he said hey put the anything any person he met he'd have you make you put on the headphones and then he would take a picture that is the marketing he and Jimmy says I was obsessive about it. Jimmy insisted that you put beats in all of your music videos and then he courted controversy Jimmy was so successful at getting athletes to wear beats headphones that beats were banned from both the 2008 Olympics and the NFL because beats wasn't one of the official sponsors again that's just another idea from history when when the first Michael Jordan shoes the Jordan brand shoes came out the NBA tried to ban them they would find Michael for wearing them Nike would pay the fine and then they would be able to buy them. That generate all this attention and I think they wanted to you know make like a couple million dollars think that idea was like we're gonna sell three to four million dollars with the shoes by the like the fourth year and I think the first year they over 100 million this just works. And so in addition to making headphones this when Jimmy's like oh I see what's coming like I don't want to be the last person to start to sell CD he starts to beats music streaming service a few years after that Apple buys both the streaming service and the headphones for three billion dollars. Now it's fascinating about that is as he was working on the deal is very secretive so he told Dre don't move don't go anywhere this absolutely can't leak obviously apples known for being super secretive. And then Dre goes into the studio when I get drunk with this guy named Tyrese Tyrese films a video of them in the studio drunk talking about the fact that Dre is now a billionaire and Jimmy couldn't believe it. He was worried is gonna spike the deal when I'm not spiking the deal but what Jimmy told people at the time about hey are you upset at you know what what Dre did is like yeah I'm obviously upset but again loyalty and long-term relationships Jimmy said but this is the horse I rode in with. I ride or die with Dre. And so after a few years he decides to pivot again and this time he pivots into retirement this is what he says I was very driven to the day that I retired and that is why I retired I didn't want to be driven anymore and it was a conscious thing. Bruce Springsteen asked me how come you're gonna retire I said look man I just left Italy with you 80,000 people yelling Bruce Bruce Bruce yeah if they were yelling Jimmy I wouldn't retire either but I talked to scumbags all day and I don't want to do that anymore. And so then finally looking back on his life he's asked you have any regrets and he gives excellent excellent advice so do you have any regrets I don't have a rearview mirror with the rearview mirror you're taking victory laps and those are a waste of time. I'm more like let's go what's new what's tomorrow that's what I was always about. So I made a lot of mistakes who doesn't but I don't care about the mistakes I don't look at life like that I took the rearview mirror out of my car a long time ago. And for me that parting advice is just like what he said earlier when you're running after something you should not look left and right what is this person think what is that person think no go.
