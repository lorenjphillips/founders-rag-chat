I want to post this conversation that I just had with my friend Patrick on his podcast of us like the best And I want to tell you why so a few weeks ago He called me after listening to the episode. It was episode 383 the one I did on todd graves It's called todd graves and his 10 billion dollar chicken figure dream and Patrick asked me to come to new york and record an episode with him on the topic of focus And if I had to simplify and distill what i've learned from this entire project, you know, eight years, maybe nine years close to nine years Almost 400 biographies of history's greatest entrepreneurs read To one word that is definitely the word that I would choose which is focus. It is I believe It is the single most prominent attribute that the people that I've studied on the podcast have That I think the rest of the world lacks. In fact I just flew to san francisco to meet and have a conversation with my friend daniel eck who is the founder of spotify We've probably talked close to four hours And there's probably not another living entrepreneur that i've learned more from than daniel and he actually gave me really great advice And I think he did this inadvertently. I don't even think he meant to And the advice was related to focus. He had told me has like more and more people Ask for your time and this happens to all of us Like if you don't guard your time, he had a great line that he said about this. He said if you don't guard your time Greatness will disappear another way to think about that is like if you lose your focus Greatness will disappear that literally gives me chills. That is terrifying to me and another thing that Me and daniel talked about Is the fact that he has this really great idea that you really should be optimizing for impact a positive impact on other people And I believe that what i'm trying to do with founders has a positive impact on the world And I should be very very very careful to not lose the focus on that because really what I believe is like The people I read about the people that you and I study on this podcast. They're they were brilliant They made incredible things they built incredible lives even though they didn't know each other They lived at different points in history lived in different parts of the world worked in different industries They arrived at very similar conclusions on how to build a great business And I think the idea is very simple I got this idea from Charlie munger where he says find an idea and take it very simple Find a simple idea and take it seriously and the simple idea I have that i'm trying to take very very seriously and focus on It's like hey somebody should read all these old books Mine these timeless ideas and then just spread them to current and future generations and this applies to everything including Who I pick to partner with on the podcast one of the most important i'll give an example this one of the most important ideas That is repeated over and over and over again is the fact that all of history's greatest entrepreneurs Constantly emphasize the importance of controlling expenses and controlling your costs This idea goes back hundreds of years You can go back and read andrew carnegie andrew carnegie would repeat a mantra over and over again He said profits and prices are cyclical subject to any number of transient forces on the marketplace Costs, however could be strictly controlled and in andrew carnegie's view any savings achieved in cost were permanent That is why I picked ramp as the presenting sponsor of this podcast I know all the founders of ramp they're friends of mine. We've spent a ton of time together Before they were the presenting sponsor of this podcast They all listened to the podcast and they picked up on the fact that the main theme from the podcast Is also the reason that ramp exists and that's the fact that the importance of watching your costs and controlling your spend and how doing so Can give you a massive competitive advantage and one thing I would add to that that I think is related to the conversation You're about to hear Doing that is also a demonstration of focus The reason that ramp exists is to give you everything you need to control your spend ramp gives you everything you need to control your costs Ram gives you easy to use corporate cards for your entire team automated expense reporting and cost control I use it for my business patch. It uses the purge business that i've gotten hundreds of emails text messages dms About people that listen to the podcast that are now using ramp for their business There is a line in andrew carnegie's biography where it said cost control became nearly an obsession keep in mind when carnegie sells his business to jp Morgan carnegie had the largest liquid fortune in the world knowing your business from a to z and your cost down to the penny Makes you very very hard to compete with in fact, I think sam walton in his autobiography Really beautifully summarized this this point and really the competitive advantage of doing so and he wrote Our money was made by controlling expenses You can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation or you can be brilliant And still go out of business if you're too inefficient ramp helps you run an efficient organization Ram gives you everything you need to control your spend and optimize all your financial operations on a single platform I believe that if andrew carnegie and sam walton were alive today, they'd be running their business on ramp make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud By going to ramp.com to learn how they can help your business today. That is ramp.com I hope you enjoy this conversation I'm very passionate about these ideas and I really appreciate patrick for giving me an opportunity to convey some of the these ideas That I think are very very important as always. Thank you for listening if I think about founders And try to simplify what it is. I would say that it's an entrepreneur lives 40 years and built something a biographer Spends four ish years researching them and writing something You spend like 40 hours Reading the book and thinking about it and tying it to all the other lessons And then you spend 40 minutes and so we spend 40 minutes listening to your summary of that thing And if you think about that incredible amount of distillation like that's a big reason. It's so interesting and so valuable So I guess my first question is to distill it even more like if you think about the entire project the entire corpus and we're forced To distill it all all your work and therefore all the work that came before it down to one thing What that one thing would be? Yeah, the one word would be focus the way I think about this is like i'm By the end of this year, I would have studied read over 400 biographies of history's greatest entrepreneurs, right? I'm like eight years into the project and if I was forced to distill that down to one word The word would be focus and the reason I think that pops out is because the way I look at this And i've told you this before Uh, we've talked about this a bunch I feel that when I when you read a biography of somebody or an autobiography is even a better example of this I feel you get to have a one-sided conversation with somebody and obviously if I do a monologue podcast I like to talk and so I can't talk so i'm just forced to sit there and listen And I feel that person is telling me, you know the most important parts of their life Their 40 50 60 year career then I go online, you know, we live in this very modern Environment I open up instagram. I look at tik tok look at x and it's like Oh the exact opposite of what this person did their whole career and what i've just spent 40 hours doing is this It's like let's not focus on something for 40 years or five decades or even 40 hours Let's focus on it for four seconds. We were on the walk over here I mentioned the point where I was like maybe the best thing for me to do because where I Do is like what I get joy is just literally like I like to spend about half my Oh the time that i'm awake alone And most of that is reading I get a lot of joy out of that and then the way I feel after I read a good book or I Make an episode that i'm proud of and then the way I feel like when I go online i'm like Oh, these are like the complete opposite They're the contrast and one is feeds my soul one is good for me and one is the opposite And so I told you I was like maybe what I should do is just like not read online at all and just post all day Long about the stuff i'm reading like use it as a tool instead of a giant distraction where I think a lot of people like It's just completely destroying their ability to focus and I think it's related to maybe why you asked me the question is like I'm very reluctant to like have an opinion on like when you listen to the podcast or when we have conversations or we're on the phone If something comes up, it's like well, you know, steve jobs would say do this or david ogilvy Did this or buffett looked at it this way or monger looked at it this way It's not like david thinks you should do this And because I don't really have an opinion on what other people should do I just think of like how I want to run my life and now i'm thinking maybe I should actually like be a little more vocal about hey It's kind of weird that the people that were literally the best at what they did in their life Were completely focused were not in this huge rush. They obviously work very fast But they're not like they didn't have goals like when i'm seeing a lot online It's like we're the fastest company ever to x revenue. It's just like they didn't talk that way like Sam walton did not talk that way coco chanel did not talk that way and so ferrari They understood they found something they loved to do and did it for an incredibly long time And so I I talked about this where I get to meet a lot of great entrepreneurs and my favorite entrepreneurs entrepreneurs I've been the most impressed with they're all over the age of 70 like all of them It was like who's the young entrepreneur admirers? I don't even know any of their names because i'm so focused on this person Has spent five decades Thinking deeply about what they're doing and the stuff they can convey With to you over like a dinner a phone call a conversation Um, I just I don't find that anywhere else and I think that's a complete byproduct of the fact that they were able to focus on something for Many many decades which is completely Uh, I would say opposite of most of human nature I think that is why it's valuable because it's so rare for people to really do that. Why does that interest you like why is the 50-year version of a business story more interesting than a 10-year version which i'm picking 10 because it's like 10 decades a long time Time is the best filter time is the only filter that I trust, you know, most of the people I cover dead If they're not dead, they're they're their career. They're at the end of the career They're an older wiser person and they're they're passing on these lessons, right? and I remember People I got a lot of pushback when ftx was taking off and all these people were telling me You got to do an episode on spf. This guy's a genius He's the fastest person to like a 35 billion dollar net worth or whatever the number was And so I was like, oh like maybe i'm like missing something like that's maybe they're right And we got to talk about todd graves in the episode I just did because i'm really proud of it. I think you know when people ask me every episode now Yeah, when people ask me who's my favorite living entrepreneur they expect me to say like a tech entrepreneur It's like no the guy that owns raising canes. They're like, what are you talking about? I got he owns 90 of a business that he started in college He's been doing it for 30 years the business is worth at least 10 billion dollars is going to 30% a year And he refuses to sell what would be the opposite of that right this slow grind to To really perfecting what you're doing before you try to like just scale it up. There's a great line I think in nick sleeps, uh partnership letters, which I just did and he's like We just don't understand why we go to these companies that are losing money and they want to figure out how to get bigger And so lose more money and he's not talking about like an amazon where you actually have to do that spf. I'm like, oh well, maybe i'm wrong Like maybe these people are right and the reason I thought about todd graves because there's so many people in his career Which we'll get to they said no you're doing it wrong and he's and we was younger. He's like damn They're like experts. They're smarter. They're like older than me like and he he started to doubt himself for a little bit And he's like wait, no, they didn't know what the fuck they were talking about. And so I was really resistant to the spf thing. So I started listening to Um all these podcasts on them and then when he does podcasts he would like multitask which my personal hero is Charlie monger, I think he's the wisest person ever come across the wisest person ever talked to and what does he say? He's like you're you're gonna get half-assed effort. That's not exact quote Like if you multitask, he just he single tasks like i'm just focused on whatever's in front of me He's this great, uh quote that I put up that went viral is like obvious He's and he's like I didn't succeed in life because of intelligence to succeed because I had a long attention span And that's what i'm so interested in to go back to your point, but then I started watching these spf podcasts and no disrespect I'm sure he's a nice guy. I'm not trying to insult him But he's like I've been on a bunch of podcasts. I've never played fucking video games Well, how fine he did Yeah, it's like this it's so first of all, it's kind of disrespectful. It's like a human level It's like you don't even deserve my full attention. You know, my phone's not here. Like we're like just having this conversation But then so I thought okay Well, maybe there's interesting ideas here and then he explains what he was doing and then I heard him say something And immediately he said this he's like well I actually think no one ever has to read a book and he talks about like he doesn't read books Books are stupid should just be a blog post and I was like, oh, there's no way i'm doing What's the chance that this young? kid, right He arrived at a conclusion that for the last 5 000 years of humanity You have all these people talking about how valuable it is to write down the lessons from the people that came before us and to Pick up that book and read the lessons and this guy comes along says no no just disregard that mass Of humanity that's not a valuable activity. I'm sorry I'm going to take monger over spf every day and i'm so glad I didn't do the episode because imagine if I had in the founders back catalog history a podcast on history's greatest entrepreneur and it's a guy that you know was essentially a fraud if you think about the That over 70 category of entrepreneur that you've learned so much from what do they do most differently in contrast to the in a hurry? fastest to 100 million arr Type entrepreneurs that you've also spent time one they just I think great anything takes time Like a great business takes time. You can be phenomenal if you look in the early days of amazon Obviously jeff was really gifted. He's really smart. He was doing a lot of smart things even before he started amazon But if you look at how good he was and how great the business was a decade two three decades in I always say this quote and I think it's dead dead, right? Uh, it's fascinating that everybody in technology has read zero to one, right? It's if you're only going to read one book That probably that would be the one to read I think it's excellent But they missed the part of what he says in there where he's like, hey Uh, there's a big problem with technology companies is they optimize for growth at the expense of durability But if you look at when do these giant companies and he said tech companies But you see this in all these companies raising canes is another example where like they actually make more money Three four five six decades into the future all the real money is out there So therefore if you're optimizing for growth at the expense of durability You're never going to get to the real rewards and the reason you do that is because growth you can track And durability you cannot And I just did this episode in ken griffin and what's fascinating is he's founded citadel I think 35 years ago and I think he found a citadel security 23 years ago And he just said we've had the most the best financial years of our entire life in the last four years He's 30 years 30 years into that business is the the best time he's had and he's you know Hopefully keeps compounding that so where does the durability come from like like how do they Those long stories how do they earn the durability? I I think what this really comes down to I like you're kind of hitting at this I think this is why Even though i'm not an investor. I do like your framing of like trying to back people that it's their life's work Um, I am very interested in people that have a mission and I don't know why It took me 32 years to find my mission another five and a half to make it to where it can actually support my family And then you know now I realize like oh this is it this is the thing i'm doing Um, I want to tie into something i've already showed you guys actually made this great. Um profound neil Yeah, and what I would say is There's a lot of good quotes in there I feel like I should do like a miniature like episode bonus episode on that one. He gave this analogy of like, um Of the helicopter It's like most people are like doing due diligence on a company or whatever and they're at like 8 000 feet and they maybe go They'll hover down to 5 000 feet and they're like, oh we did our job They're like no no neil lands the helicopter then gets out of the helicopter then goes underneath the helicopter and then puts his hands in the dirt And I read that I don't think of any entrepreneur living. I think oh, that's Walt Disney. That's Steve jobs. That's s.t lauder That's all the people that admire that's Todd grace. Uh, it sounds like I heard stories. Uh, I was just at this dinner last weekend for somebody that knows ken And they asked what episode i'm working on was like, oh i'm working on episode ken griffin and they were telling stories That were very similar at that paying attention to even this is the tiniest corner of the business You wouldn't even think he's paying attention to you But he's spending gonna sit there and talk to the person responsible for three straight hours to make sure it's being done I just like people that take what they're doing seriously the feedback on the tiger's episode. It's absolutely ripping but the the only negative feedback is like I can't because he says in the episode That he believes that god put him on earth to be good at chicken fingers to help people so he can make a lot of money and he does a lot of like charitable work and people are like You know, they think they're smart too obsessed with chicken figures. They think they're smarter than him They essentially what they're saying is like, you know, have you built a 10 billion dollar company? Have you done that? Are you the best in your profession? Are you the top of your craft? It doesn't matter what the craft is At least he has a mission You may laugh at his mission. You think it's ridiculous But one I know he believes it for a fact or he's the world's greatest actor for three decades, right? And we can go through the level of commitment that he had to make that dream real, right? Or like and you can make fun of the fact that he's a mission But it's like he's already ahead of most of humanity that is alive today and has ever lived Most people don't have a mission There's a great example of this in in steve jobs that he was heavily criticized in early of his career Because he would make the inside of the computer that you couldn't even open up Beautiful and people you're wasting your time. It wasn't a waste of time to him The reason I like the graves one so much Is because it's chicken fingers like the object of his obsession Is like this sort of low status thing I think so many people would love to build a fancy piece of technology or something very sexy as their lifelong mission or something but in in many of my conversations with you the object of obsession is Something very simple like chicken fingers and I just think chicken fingers is like it's such like a visceral thing We've all eaten chicken fingers And a man like todd has devoted himself to one thing I think you said on the episode he won't even make people wanted a sandwich and he just Took his chicken fingers and put buns around it Like he is singularly obsessed with with this chicken finger dream And I love the question now. What is your chicken finger dream? And chicken finger is better than something else because of almost how absurd it is so Tell us a little bit more about what you've learned from studying him I it was probably my favorite episode of founders ever And maybe just hit me at the right time and I needed to hear that message right then and there to work on something For an absurdly long time not think short term, whatever Lots of common lessons, but what is it about? Why do you think this one is so especially this person and this business which is so simple and so lowbrow So resonant with so many people I truly believe like I'm obsessed and we we've talked about this all time like, you know I get literally emails. They're like, why do you quote monger in every single episode? And it's just like because all I do is listen to this what I thought this brilliant guy his advice and I just did it Like I always say learning is not memorizing information learning is changing your behavior And there's been a handful of times where I meet people I read a book I have a conversation where literally my behavior and that my behavior has changed the trajectory of my life has changed The way he was able to describe things to me. He's just like there's a bunch of examples where he's and he's like, you know He knows everything about business history. He had 60 years of experience and he would share Freely with everybody and he's like occasionally we find scaling down and upping the intensity you get an advantage That sounds like tug graves to me. He's like, oh you have my competitors have 10 things on the On the menu. I have one you can get three chicken fingers four chicken fingers six chicken fingers and you want chicken chicken sandwich Here's two buns and that's it And then find a simple idea and take it seriously is another mongerism And then what he realized when he analyzed cosco where he's like we find oftentimes in business We find the winning system goes ridiculously far That's the most important two words in this sentence ridiculously far in maximizing and or minimizing one or a few variables Uh, I think it was ken griffin talked about this. I've seen this with a bunch of investors. Um, We talked about this with richard rainwater before Jay pritzker was like this sam zell was like this because we'll tie this to investing It's like if you bring them a deal and there's like seven different things that have to go right like the chance of every Single one going right is very very small And so like I love what richard rainwater would do where it's like you bring me your idea on one piece of paper You write it on one piece of paper explain to me in simple words And then at the end just tell me how much your own money you're putting in and then i'll decide if i'm going to do this This guy was one of the best deal makers, you know investors of all time. You see it over and over again sam zell told me When I got to meet him, it's also in his autobiography. He's like jay pritzker was the most brilliant financial mind I've ever come across he was like an older brother to sam He's like 20 years older and his whole point was like i'd come to him when I was younger and bring him like okay There's like six things we have to do and jay would look at he's like no one If you nail that everything else will will uh, everything else will either work out It will either live or die off of that. They go back to win in the huge mania in you know with uh, 2020-21 all this huge tech bubble where sam zell goes on cnbc is like we works going to zero Like no not gonna work and it was like at all times high mussels putting in like 20 billion dollars in other cases It was like asset price liability mismatch or whatever the word he's like no this guy in 1972 did this failed 82 this other guy did it this is the company failed Why because there's only one thing that's important an app doesn't fucking solve that you're not paying attention And so when I look at todd graves, the reason I wanted to do that episode is one I I just saw a clip This is what I mean about learning is not memorizing information learning is your changing behavior I talked to a lot of people and they're like I love your podcast and some of them become friends with and I see The decisions they're making their uh business like oh you don't you're listening and you're just wasting your time Because you're not actually applying the lessons take what they did and what they said and see if that works in your business And then actually change it and so I saw a clip And it was a clip I think on tiktok where todd graves was being interviewed on a comedian's podcast And he was talking about he's like i've been a big believer in always doing one thing and doing it better than anybody else And then they kept cutting the clip, you know, it's probably 45 seconds and he talked about he even got down to the minutia of How simple is my menu if this does how easy can I make it to select what the customer wants? Okay, so that customer is now going to take five seconds to decide I go to reason kids I know exactly what i'm getting right as opposed to You go to mcdonald's or there are other competitors now. It's Instead of a 10 second order. It's a 40 second order That mean make not a big difference when you're having, you know, 100 orders a day and you have one store He's got 800 now. It makes a huge difference and he just immediately understood And so when I might this is how because I fucking brainwashed myself about this I don't think of todd graves when I hear that i'm like, oh, that's like rockefeller going over to one of his employees who was soldering Closing up oil cans and says how many drops of solder do you use and the guy's like 40? Have you ever tried less try 38? Okay. I tried 38 it leaked. Okay. I tried 39 Oh 39 it works. So we were wasting one drop of solder which might not make a shit of difference when the business is You know making a couple thousand that business went up scaling 10 20 30 x Makes a huge difference all of these people they're obsessed with their business. They're it they're in the details Another thing that todd graves said that was very fascinating. He's like I had all these experts tell him hey Like you should delegate and he has the funny sign goes delegate. What is that word even? He goes what kind of word is that right because he was literally being interviewed in one of the in one of the um One of the podcasts I use as a source material to make mine and He's again this this this happened, you know in the last few months Maybe a year ago and he stops the interview to look at the instagram reel Because they just had an event I think they were like throwing a super bowl party or something like that And he's like i'm gonna watch it before it goes out. I don't think of todd graves. I think of steve jobs Every wednesday having a three-hour meeting in apple reviewing every single ad that goes out Nothing went out of apple Not a billboard in missouri not a what's on their landing page without steve looking at it There's a guy that wrote the book called. I think it's called insanely simple I think his name is ken seagull if i'm if i'm correct if i'm correct about that He was running he was working he was the ad executive Uh for the the marketing company the ad company that steve was using and he said steve would call me at midnight And we'd have to talk for an hour about a single word That's obsession that's loving what you do that's taking what you do very seriously I don't care if it's building computers if it's making a podcast if it's making chicken fingers I just love people that take what they do seriously this idea of anything worth doing being worth doing for its own sake And my favorite maxim, you know that i've stumbled across I think originally from kevin kelly The old editor of wired magazine was that the reward for great work is more work And it seems like so much of the fastest to 100 million of arr type thing Is that the target is something that's not the work itself. It's some other thing And that the healthy orientation that you're describing that todd graves has and all these other people have is actually just towards the work itself And you had this really interesting notion of almost anti-business People ivan schubert is the the founder of patagonia comes most immediately to mind. I love that book of his Yeah, i'll let my people go surfing So talk a little bit more dig deeper on this idea of Anything worth doing for its own sake the reward for great work is more work being anti-business as a as an entrepreneur There's some depths to this that I think continue to pull out the same thread You can change the name of a podcast. I can log into my podcast host and change founders to whatever I want Whatever you can't change the url slog for the rss feed for the first name you picked And the first name I picked for founders was telling you from day one back in 2016 The name of the podcast was called auto telec auto telec the definition of that is an activity done for the sake of itself I was telling you from the rip. I don't care if nobody listens. I need to do this I got some advice the other day and they're like This reminds me of ted graves henry ford has the exact same thing about you know experts people outside of your business try to give You advice and this is why I like read twitter. I'm like these people like sorry. I'm not going to read that tweet I'd rather i'll just listen what steve job said I'd probably he probably has better advice than this random fucking guy on twitter And so somebody goes hey have a great idea for you. Have you ever thought about hiring other people to read the books for you? I like That's not what i'm doing it for i'm not taking the easy way the heart I love what jerry sinan thought that the hard way is the right way and so I told them a story and this is the line That this is my response to this And this is the line that I say is like you don't work all your life To do what you love to not do it And all I know is that person doesn't have a mission. They don't have a love they're not That's fine. I don't most people never do But I don't go around It's the people about what they should be doing It's it's the weird thing where the source of this advice comes from and I remember reading about charles schultz the guy I was a fucking kid and i'd read Charlie brown and peanuts every christmas we'd watch charlie brown's uh christmas Yeah, so I think he came out in the 1960s and so I was like i'm gonna read his biography and then you read it And it's like crazy. It's like the guy ran, you know, I'm gonna these are approximately right he ran the Uh the comic strip for like let's say 40 or 50 years he drew drew came up with the idea Penciled everything drew it in every single strip Over 50 years. I think it was 17 000 different individual ones That he did Uh, he had already had one planned. So when he dies, this is the last no one can ever take it over when I die This is what you put out Like when I die, this is the last one's ever published and people would go through it if I remember correctly Living somewhere in california to come tour his studio at a time. He's a much older man. He's like 67 years old and they're like Well, who's doing this? He's like what do you mean? He's doing this. It's like me And they couldn't these people touring the street couldn't wrap their head like well Could you hire somebody else to do it so then you could take it like a vacation or you could take some time off And that was his line. He's like You couldn't understand why they were asking him that and he's like but you don't work your entire life to do what you love To not do it That's why I think thinking a long time You know most of this is trial and error some people find what they love to do really like I think of kobe bryant The episodes are done on him. It's 12 years old. He would tell you i'm gonna be the best basketball player of all time No one finds what they love to do at 12. I'm working this michael del episode right now You could see from 12 years old the guy was a moneymaker's obsessed with computers There's a part in the story that's great where he takes apart an ibm and he has this realization He says wait a minute ibm selling the computer But they don't make any of the components and like you just see as like a little kid's like hmm There might be an opportunity here that he's going to pursue later on and then he gets in trouble in class because he's he's not Paying attention class. He's just reading computer magazines. He's telling you What his life what his life is going to be you just have to listen and every single person Has something like that. They just don't fucking listen. They don't listen to themselves. What does it feel like when you find it? Because you said earlier you were 32 Before you kind of stumbled on it and then five years after that was it like actually the full-time thing that you could do Turn a living and and much more What what was the change in feeling of what does it feel like to do the thing that you love to you? unbelievable relief Like a weight off your shoulders that like I can't describe it Um, and then from there that doesn't mean like oh now I wake up, you know That's like i'm kind of a tortured person like so there was a clip of me on another podcast I just went out and the person's like, you know, the podcast is good if the Host looks sleep deprived. I'm like that's as bad as good as I can look Okay, because that's like my sleep score on my a sleep right now is like 60 It's not i'm not doing well because I am completely obsessed with what i'm doing And I you know, it's weird like people keep telling me it's like you Like you shouldn't be obsessed with this like low status the ass like I you're wrong I I don't type status now I don't even I don't even hear it because i'm like I I know exactly where I am And I know exactly what I want to do and we talk about this We have mutual friends that like they're kind of so obsessed to their detriment about like What will somebody else think of me or like if I do x well like i'm worried about the public perception or what? My friends will think me. I don't think about that at all There's a great line the reason that uh Like people are surprised with some of the people that I want to meet that are still living And so I have like, you know A list and in the top three that list is this guy named jimmy. I've been we mean you share a love for that Defiant ones defiant ones documentary Last dance defined ones like those are the best documentaries. I watch them over and over again And jimmy iven has this great line. He's just like when you're running after something He goes they do this great editing job where it shows horses on a racetrack And it and it goes back and forth between that and jimmy and jimmy's like, you know Why they put fucking blinders on those horses and uh, he goes he goes because if they look left or right they'll miss a step And humans should have that too when you're chasing after something. Don't look left. Don't look right Go and that's why it's like I wake up every day We talked about this when we did that live show in new york city It's obvious if you read the books that the great entrepreneurs once they find what they have they love to do low to zero introspection Now they think deeply about their business, but they wake up every morning. They're not wondering like what should I do today? They know exactly what they're doing and to find that for me to know i'm gonna wake up and do this For as long as I have a voice. I have eyes like hopefully I have life Like that's an unbelievable relief now because it's your mission and because i'm also super competitive and kind of a little crazy Uh, our mutual friend daniel ac has the great the greatest line He told me he's just like one of the reasons I like you so much is because you're like, uh an llm Train on history's greatest entrepreneurs with the temperature turned It's like yeah, obviously like some people are not gonna like that and that's fine Then you you kind of torture I did this episode on jensen wong and he has a great thing where he doesn't like to fire People he's like i'd rather to torture them into greatness And then you realize when you how he goes about his life. He actually tortured himself into greatness You know even this is in recent few years. They tell a great story blowout quarter Companies doing incredible and he he walks into the meeting goes every morning. I wake up look myself in the mirror and say Why do you suck so much? We've heard that a few times from some exceptional people. They're all like this They're all like this say one click more about this anti-business. You call that anti-business billionaires so that I would get lots of these on Um instagram or whatever. That's not why I did it though because that's what I believe them to be I like I I appreciate you thought it was click baiting. I'm not trying to click bait anybody Although although todd graves and his 10 billion dollar chicken finger dream is probably good. That's a banger episode. I don't What I mean by anti and it really should be anti-business as usual billionaires, okay So the and again i'm my own business I don't care if people say I want to wake up and all I'm going to do is take a pile of money making It a bigger pile of money and they love it. Cool. I have no opinion what you're doing The the people I most admire the people that i'm trying to powder myself off of Is these people where it's like they have so they're so obsessed About the product quality right what and there's three people in that video It's evon chenard james dyson and steve jobs, right? One guy is making outdoor equipment one guy's making high technology and one guy's making fucking vacuum cleaners Okay, but there's the exact same approach where it's like the the reasons company exists and and and jobs has said this multiple times Where the the only reason sort of company is because the product And then like you so the company needs to assemble all the resources But the product is it we exist to make the product and then of course you he talks about profitability a lot Because the profits allow you to keep making the product everything starts from the product So everything I do the reason I still do every single social media post the reason I answer all my emails The reason I don't have an assistant the reason I don't have an editor is because i'm trying to make the world's best product I feel my podcast is a handmade Artisanal but it just happens to be like technology and infinite leverage You know the same amount of work is going to go into it if one person listens or 10 million people listen and i'm trying to build what drives me and I think annoys most of the people that are around me because I can be like pretty fucking stubborn about this Is that I want to make the best? Pod the best product in the world Based on what I like for the best people in the world the very first time we talked you kind of And this is when I had like I think like 3 000 people listening Back then and you kind of nailed it on our first talk You're like, oh you you built it like you're going to win by default You built this pulling mechanism in the founder ecosystem like by the time people try to do it now They're going to try to cat they'll never be able to catch you But I it's really important to me as a competitive person that I build the best product for the best people in the world I am not interested. I've told this story before I know mr Beast jimmy's he's been very nice to me. He's tweets about the podcast. It's very nice He's invited me to go uh to like his headquarters and he's like you can use our studio record here We'll help you with the script jimmy's there's no script. Uh, we'll give you data analytics people I don't even know how many fucking people listen to the podcast. I don't look at analytics. I build what I want for me So the reason I have to edit it is because when this is done I listen to it. It's the it's the stephen king thing. I am not just the writer. I am the first reader That's what stephen king said Quentin tarantino says when I people like when you make a movie, do you have an audience? Somebody's like yeah me i'm making it for me. What is your own measure of good or great for your own product? That I like it But but why like what what is it about whatever that episode was or the tide graves episode or like if I stack ranked There are 50 most recent episodes based on the quality your own perception of their quality What's different about number one versus number 40 like what's more true in number one than number 40? Like what is the measure of goodness? I have been thinking about this recently and um, it it applies specifically to the fact that i'm covering people that build companies and what I realize is like I've never been around impressive people my entire life, right? We talked about this the very first time i was on your podcast No one in my family even graduated high school. What's this college? So it's like I never saw examples of great people and then you add to the fact that my father Like i'm the son of a cuban immigrant. I grew up meeting people that risked their lives and came over here on a raft And it's like kind of weird. Hey Like you you have like we both have kids We love them more than life itself Like I would die for my kids everybody would die for their kids And it's like things were so bad in your country that you risked your 14 year old son's life and put him on a boat Like how bad does it have to be and i'm like, well, let's go to the miami beach How many people how many americans are getting on a raft and going that's a one-way trip? So that tells you something is very special about where we live and very very bad about where they're coming from And what I realized is like not being not being an educated family Parents never having money the being terrified growing up terrified being a loser. It's like entrepreneurship is a miracle Capitalism is a miracle where I meet some of these other people where they're like They might be the son or the grandson of somebody really wealthy and you'll find like a weird high correlation for like almost like socialistic uh Like perspectives and I was like this is so crazy to me just like my wife's from columbia like no one no one in south america is like That made it to america is like no I want to go back there like you don't even understand what you have And so now what what I realized about this is like one of the reasons i'm so passionate about is yeah, I like to read The most unbroken hobby i've ever had yeah, I legitimately think podcasts are miracles you we were at this Conference together and you said something really funny you walk over and every time i'm at another table and i'm i'm like Most of people listen to the podcast, but if not, I would grab their phone You saw me installing it and you had a quip you're like I wish I could find a way to make money for david's ability to turn every conversation back to podcasting It's like 14 really successful capital allocators and me. I don't even know what the hell I was doing there The root cause is like I really believe entrepreneurship is a miracle the fact that anybody could say hey I have an idea that makes somebody else's life better because that's the best that's all businesses business is just an idea That makes somebody else's life better No one can stop me from doing it to delivering value to other people and then if I deliver the more value I deliver to the higher number of people that generates wealth what Imagine going back to you know I might do this episode on jengis khan like the 1100s and saying like you could be the richest person in the world and you Could you invented a button and you know, if you press that button and anything is delivered to that or like any other? Sam walton, I told the story I was in my v-shirt marine on a friend's boat and I was like That boat's huge who owns that boat and I look it up. It's like Sam walton's Niece and I'm like this guy I had like this this great experience. I'm looking at this giant boat It's probably I don't know 300 million dollars some crazy number like that and I'm like and it came from your uncle just realizing hey Uh, if I just deliver everyday low prices again another simple idea taken very seriously Everyday low prices no one's gonna beat us on pricing. So how do you work backwards from that idea? There's all kinds of technologies to the logistics. There's Challenge all those other stuff is very difficult the idea is simple But the definition is very difficult and look what you can generate and people shit on walmart I had to shop at walmart when I grew up Like i'm not shopping there now but like it did a service for my family And for millions of people's like they destroyed mainstream businesses. It's like we couldn't afford to not shop on one It's a miracle that he gave and what's the byproduct of that by making I don't know how many people you think shop walmart billions by now a lot billions everyone at some point Yeah, he deserves that money good. I'm glad he got that money I mean he he wrote a lot in his books about the relationship between simplicity and mastery Yeah, and that's I mean that's the theme of our conversation like it shows up over and over and over and over again That conference you're referencing with the capital allocators, you know, you said I don't know why i'm there Well, I know why you were there like I wanted you to go because I had a theory which was correct Which is that the people there were going to be more interested in you and your project Than you know, the next guy is like latest great investment and I think the reason for that is that everyone recognizes a truth in this basic message of the power of finding one's mission and then pursuing it forever and I would just love to hear you riff a little bit on what that has taken For for you in the last I guess we met in 2022 So called three and a half four years ago something like that In that period of time, which is when this thing has really taken off What are your drops of you know glue or like what are the things that you've? Done had to do to make this thing better Because I just want to keep bringing this point to life that like once you find the thing What kinds of things does it then take to make the thing great? So what have those things been for the last, you know, four years? I don't even know if I can um, I have a good answer to that question other than there is something that I think is Two other lines from monger again. I go back to him where it's like he says intense interest in any subject is Necessary for like to master it. He has a better line I'm messing that up and then he says fall or nutter drift, you know We talk about this all the time where when I describe you to other people i'm like Well, you have to understand patrick is doing invest like the best episodes all day long every day Like 10 times a day. He just doesn't record them. He's just naturally curious He will he just want he's curious around other people in the way that I am frankly not Right i'm interested in books. I don't I can't like deal with you know people it's why I work alone, uh in general like obviously I have a handful of very close people, but I just think I I don't know why there's a great line So I just did this kennett griffin episode and I made the point the episode I think is really important Is like i'm not interested in timely i'm interested in timeless and so there's no book on ken There's a bunch of great stories spread throughout the internet that I use as source material and I listen to every single thing I could find all these talks and most of the reviews he does is like what do people want to know? What do you think about the market? What do you think about this president? But I did find like he had this hour-long talk at yale highly recommend listening to it Where's like more like almost like an oral biography like more timeless principles And then I transcribed that and then you know, I listened to I don't know 30 other hours of him talking and I maybe only made like Five or ten other notes something small but something he said is very fascinating. He's like For reasons I don't quite understand Since I was in the third grade i've been obsessed with the stock market How does it work? How do you make money? What are the problems you can solve in that line for reasons? I don't understand. I truly believe that jeff bezos nailed it when he said you don't pick your passions your passions choose you You don't choose your passions your passions choose you I was not like, you know at five years old wondering like what's a good hobby for her For self-development in my future. I maybe should read I just read I told you the first time we talked Like my mom before she died said I would read the back of cereal boxes. It's I have no idea And so all I do is like i'm just Intensely interested in everything that i'm i'm learning and then I like the craftsmanship. I heard um, there's There's an idea that ken has that again I think is an entire reason that founders is valuable as a podcast He says you really you you want to know what's going on in your business You want to sell your competitors? But you really should be grabbing ideas from other businesses far afield from your industry and he told a story about a way to mitigate his risk And he got an idea from saudi ramco saudi ramco and citadel is very different businesses, right? What was the idea? Okay, so i'll explain this Make sure I don't forget that because i'm in i'm in the middle of the weave um So he would they were he used the term I think they were like they were like be a b player in risk They weren't doing well on risk And he was still in chicago at the time and he goes and visits saudi ramco and he sees this giant Screen on a wall in their headquarters there and it's like 30 feet long 10 feet wide and it has all the most important data not like a hundred things but like Where the ships are how many oil the barrels of oil we're reducing like the handful of metrics and they just look at all day Yeah, they're distillation exactly what's gonna happen like you look at all day Like then you're gonna improve it right and he's like Oh, what if we took all the important risk men metrics and put on a giant wall in our headquarters? And he said it took him from like, you know B player to like one of the best in their field and his whole advice was like you really need to be taking ideas that Are far afield of like your own industry and you know, that's what you do when you read a book Like i'm not going to build walmart. I'm not going to build ferrari. I'm not building apple I'm building my podcast but there's all these ideas that I can take from them So as I expose myself to that I just find like little ideas that I can use in the craftsmanship of the product and one of the main ideas goes Back to your question about the anti-billion Anti-business billionaires the reason I say And I do this same book over and over again So i've done an episode 25 episode 200 episode 300 and it'll be episode 400. It's james dyson's first autobiography called against the odds He it took him 14 years 5127 prototypes until he got a The first the world's first cyclonic vacuum cleaner that he owned 100% of that was up to his standards and so all i'm trying to figure out is like Can I make something that I would listen to? I don't know any other way And so last week I actually had to republish an old episode which is still a great episode But the reason was because I read a book where I found the person I did not like and I don't want to spend any time In his lot in his mind So i'm not gonna make an episode on him because not only do I have to finish reading the book which I threw across the fucking room but Then I have to spend another you know probably reading this one together if it's the one I think yes And then I spent another 30 then I just spent another 30 hours making the podcast This is I don't I don't want to be like this person I'm looking for role models because I didn't have any when I grew up And then I read a fabulous book that me and you both read uh pappy land by rait thompson excellent writing writer too, yeah unbelievable but I don't know. I couldn't figure out how to make an episode on it because it's really like it's it's about a family business It's really about a family and it's really about the relationship between a father and son like and i'm very interested in that relationship I think it's the most powerful relationship in the world, which I got heckled at one of our live shows when I said that Um, why did you get heckled? I don't remember they were just because I said it was the most it's it's not discounting the relationship between a father or daughter Or mother and just like it's clearly something that pops up in these biographies over and over again all the time And he and right has right thompson has great writing about you know Relationship that the grandson had with the father and the father with it was just a lot of family language excellent book But I was like this isn't good enough that the book was but I can't make anything good enough. So i'm not putting anything out Nothing i'm not going to put out something I wouldn't listen to one of my favorite things that happens with you is someone will say something that just bothers you And sets you off and gets you going on this stream of lessons that we're talking about today that you've learned that you've shared with people What other things that you see people do bother you the most in business? You have a great line on this like you talk to way more people than I do And i'll ask you about like oh is this person this person reached out and you're like, oh No, he's a casual again. I don't care what people do because they're I know Because I study fucking people's lives for a living like so much of what shapes you is like It happens when you're so young and you can't even describe why you're interested in what you're interested in But I think the only thing that bothers me is like There's a great line uh that I mentioned in the ovitz episode that uh Mediocrity is invisible until passion shows up and exposes it and so much of the people that you meet so many lines So many of the products that you deal with so many people it's just like they're casual they have a casual Affectation about them that I find personally disgusting And i'm not again. It's not like I grow on judging people. It's gonna make me sound like a terrible human being It's just like it's a way for me to filter who I want to spend time with and my favorite people to spend time with Like they're all they all work in vastly different things, but they take what they do So seriously and it's not a selfish thing. They're making something that they feel Makes somebody else's life better um, so the only thing I could think of is like I don't like the you know casualness and then i'm not a fan personally of like the over financialization of Business, I think a lot of people aren't starting companies. They're creating financial instruments, which is fine But I think you're gonna realize like just these kind of people just don't have enough experience and they haven't read enough biographies to realize like You think what you want is money? But what you really want is meaning You're gonna get the money and then you're gonna be like why am I so unhappy? Because you're human and this happens over and over again That doesn't mean people don't like money and that obviously solves a lot of benefits But you're gonna feel a lot better if you think about the reasons that people sell a business Typically, it's it's either because they have a chance to make a tremendous amount of money Or some amount of money or it's because they're tired of the thing of the business therefore of the product of the whole endeavor Why do you think that the money thing? Has become I would think about it as like a false idol or something like it has become the unit of Interest of obsession of showing off of status of all this kind of stuff What's your theory for why this seems to have been reflected like so crazily in the last? Couple of years. Well now we have like a giant mirror into everybody else's life We never had like this way like thinking of like one good thing about decentralization of media is like there's no gatekeepers That's also the bad thing in the sense of like now there's somebody just put me onto crazy rich asians of tik-tok and It is some of the most caught that one. Oh, we should i'll send you some clips and um And it's some of the most disgusting behavior. Like one lady, uh is I guess her parents own she lives in california But her parents own one of the largest like cloud computing companies in china another one is like some giant maybe even like Uh government collusion in singapore or something like that, but it's like all the all the videos All the videos are just straight consumption It's look what I got me and my and they do this this thing where it's like me and my mom went shopping today and we spent 25 000 of van cleef and then we bought a hermay thing and we did this and it's like This is disgusting behavior because you're you shouldn't take pride in what you consume That doesn't take skill or talent. You should take pride in what you built That is the most selfish thing you could possibly do and i'm not again like dude Like i'm building the goal here is to you know, to change the trajectory of my entire Family tree i'm going to build generational wealth not so my kids can do that shit That'll never happen But to try to teach him it's like man the wealth came because you made somebody else's life better you dedicated it's a it's a selfless act even if you love it and this idea that like we are So I understand that it's like so then young people see that and they're like oh That I need to figure out how to make money and I was like this like I was So embarrassed when I was younger that had to like how much I had to work or like I didn't have a car Or like all this other stuff that happened. I remember being deeply deeply embarrassed and then switching from embarrassment to like almost uh Like relentless self-belief that like I am better than that Person like I remember going there was this kid that lived close to like went to the same school as me It was a public high school, but I remember the crazy story I heard where like I think he again this was like it's funny when you think of wealth Like his dad owned like I don't know like 100 dominos or something, but I just remember they used to take a helicopter to lunch And i'm like what and I remember him bragging about the car his dad bought him like 120,000 in my car He'd park in front of the country club Which obviously I would never even be able to get into the country club and I remember flipping and I was like i'm Better than that kid like i'm smarter than him. I work harder like i'm gonna fuck him up And it turned into like this competitive like I will prove to you that like You what was handed to you? I will get myself Um, and there was like some kind of weird drive behind that But so when I see people like that where it's just like you're glorifying the wrong thing We're like if you think about there's this great talk that Steve Jobs gave when he came back to apple and he's talking about Apple spends all this money on marketing. You would never know it. It sucks all your marketing sucks. He's like who are the best? What is the best example of marketing and he talked about nike and he's like, what does nike do? He doesn't talk about like the shoe is has a bunch of six bubbles or whatever. They they glorify great athletes They glorify great achievement And so that's why he did the crazy ones ad and so I think that's like to some degree what i'm trying to do is like the reason I Make these clips on the anti-business billionaires the reason I spend so much time talking about these people and the craftsmanship and talk about This guy that is literally a craftsmanship with his chicken figures Is because I to to some degree I like I want to celebrate these people Saying hey, i'm going to dedicate my life to building the best possible product I can and to make somebody else's life better And i'll talk all day long about that and not about the fact that you know I'm building a yacht or i'm doing all this other stuff like you can have all these things But like what are you actually proud of you're not proud of your consumption. What are you proud? Anybody can go to the store and buy that Not everybody can build a truly great product. Why are the people that are doing it that way? so much better at marketing than like If you read a marketing book and you know tried to go market your product or had some Marketing person at your company in charge of how the world hears about you I'm thinking about the red bull founder estee lauder like this seems to steve jobs Of course this shows up over and over again that Not only is the ability to create an incredible product. I gotta love that line of mediocrity is invisible until passion shows up to Exposes to expose it. Um, so I won't forget that one but the same thing seems to happen So that's the product side the same thing seems to happen from all these same people on the marketing side What is the flame there that's behind that like why what have you learned about that side of of business studying all these people? Where they're not only responsible for the product but also for how the world engages with it and hears about it Uh again, I'd go back to those three evan chenard james dyson and steve jobs I think they have all these lessons in that evan chenard calls it non-fiction marketing He's like if you have a shit product like you have to like dress it up you have to put you have to have a mascot You have to hire these expensive Uh advertising companies, uh, you know You have to make up all this stuff. It's all fiction But if you just in his thing, he didn't even want to be a billionaire He just like hey i'm going to again. He built a product for himself. He was a mountaineer He was he spends all his time outdoors. He fishes he mountain. Uh, he skis he Climbs mountains he does all these super risky sports all the gear i'm using sucks I'm going to make the gear that I use and guess what if I make the best gear then everybody's like where'd you get that? Oh, that's good, too And it takes best friend exactly exactly and that'll compound again if you don't sell after five years or four years or do anything that that Puts in jeopardy the durability of your company. And so I think about james dyson is this great line and i'll like paraphrase but How he wants to spend his time? He wants to invent he wants to be as close to the possible to the design of the product the manufacturing of the product He will be on the line of the product even in the 70s, right? But what he realized is like After he's done making the product. He's the one that went around the world And sold the product because he's like the creator Is the only person that can explain what went into the process of the thinking behind it and then with his full heart He's something like that with the full heart and complete belief in what he's saying Foisted upon other people at a high price Because he knows hey, yeah this you can go and buy a vacuum cleaner for four 40 bucks or 600 guess what my house I have a dyson. It's the best vacuum cleaner. It just is and i'm asking you to pay 10x for you can get You know anywhere else why and I can tell you what went into it the blood sweat and tears I kind of reject this like purely rational Like the way people like they they try to analyze business in a rational way Which is weird to me because humans are nothing but irrational and they give money for reasons They can't describe and some of this like why would somebody pay, you know? I love this this thing that uh, you see with like ends of for are you guys did a great post about this When you did a Ferrari episode and it showed like the racetrack the test track and they're like, here's the test track and then Literally ends of for his house. He built the racetrack around his house, right? It's just like why do people come from all over the world to meet this guy, right? And to buy a come buy a car That you know Is a hundred times 10 times 20 30 times more expensive than just another car that could go fast. There's a story behind it And I think that's where like you see the people that love the product so much They put so much of their life's energy into it that then they can explain very clearly Why it's valuable the reason i'm not trying to be like obnoxious When I ask people to listen to the podcast and they don't I tell them take out their phone I heard this great thing and this is another idea I got from paul bram We said in the early days of stripe they call it the collison installation Where they're like, oh the other yc companies like I love to use stripe and they'd be like, oh great Give me your laptop and they would install it right then and so I saw that idea great idea I'm gonna do this center installation. And so i've done this over and over. I don't even know. I probably installed it I don't know. I'm not joking like 500 times like oh, this is gonna be the best day you've ever had You're gonna look back on this day Unbelievable what this podcast is gonna do for your career here follow right there Like I think this is james cameron episode is the best episode ever done Maybe the red bull episode maybe the chicken finger episode But like I can tell you that with a straight face and not feel shameful Or shameless or whatever the term is there about doing that because I believe in it It took a lot of fucking work to make that and I know the lessons are good because that guy told you they're good What is it about the red bull? story Uh, it's so unique. It's so different. It's one of my favorites they've ever done. So This is another again like it's like you you know me well enough. I'm getting hot. Um, You know me well enough. It's just like i'm not like somebody could offer me like come run my company or like pay me more money Like there's just no way I would do that. Like i'm not doing there's other ulterior motives for it and one like If you're really smart, you can find a way to build a good business almost anything It's not what you do. It's how you do it with dietras mattress. It's like His whole thing one the story is crazy crazy because at the time I did that episode There's no biographies in english. So like this is also what drives me insane in everything You should be thinking about differentiation the reason I started a solo podcast Right on history podcast in 2016 is because in 2016. I thought there was way too many I can't go interview entrepreneurs. Everybody's already doing that right and there's obviously something I didn't understand It's always room for great, right? But I did I have this natural Inclination i've had my entire life to like go in the other direction that other people are doing so I knew was differentiated And the what I what I love about the episodes I love the most is like there's not even a book about it You have to like make the content for the episode so I had to translate or a friend of mine translated That biography from german So first of all, it's like oh good like how many people have done an episode on this guy based on this book? Well, if you haven't spoke german none, right? So and then you you realize the story is just like, you know He was working for a bunch of cpg companies traveling to asia. He's jet-lagged all time. He He winds up finding the red bull, but it's in a different language It's like 15 cents or whatever the case is he's like, oh this this this works and there's really no like energy drink category So he helps create the category and then masters the category and then realizes you have a lot of like You really need to raise the price and then even the way he looked at things where he's like, oh, we're a marketing conglomerate So we're gonna outsource everything else about marketing It's like everybody's talking about content to commerce and all this other stuff today. It's like this is nothing is new You just haven't read enough history like you want to look at the best content to commerce right there And then what does he do? He optimizes for he did not want to have a board of directors He did not want to be in the public stock market. He didn't want to be answerable to anybody the guy I mean the guy wasn't married like you just look at it People give you hints about what's important to them. Just look read between the lines and you clearly see he doesn't like people telling What to do. He has a ton of fun. He's also crazy. He likes to like even well to the 70s He was like taking risky sports mountain biking. He had he was like flying his own planes racing his own cars He was like the red bull like the the brand of red bull was him And then you get to the point where him and his partner they each own 49 percent of the company They fit 500 000 each then they had a small bank loan Every single thing from the growth from there was out of profits How many people essentially can bootstrap if me if somebody gave me and you have a business right now, right? You're gonna put in half a million. I'll put in half a million. We're gonna get a small bank loan You know hard the unlikely outcome that you and I build a business that's worth 40 or 50 or 60 billion dollars You know hard that is how the hell did he do that? There's a great line by charlie monger when he says one of my favorite ways One of my favorite ways of knowledge is finding an extreme example and asking what the hell happened here You know and and you're like in my case. It's like people it's like What there's a guy there's some austrian guy That owns red bull that is turning down his he turned on multiple offers where he would have made 20 billion for his 49 He's paying himself 500 to 800 million a year uh He's so private that he buys the magazine that's trying to write a story about him Like there's a guy that is trying to write an unauthorized biography of him goes to his mom's house Dietrich finds the guy and says if you don't leave my mom alone I'm gonna i'm gonna pay a russian guy to break your knees your kneecaps It's like what is happening here? What who is this person and I think that's really important because all it does is like completely pops off the top of your head About what is possible in life the reason i'm obsessed with these Maniacs on emissions these super driven people these the opposite of casual people is because it's like they stretch what I believe is possible Let me give you a perfect example there's um There's this recurring theme on the podcast. It's in all these biographies and I the shorthand I have for this is how bad do you want it? And I just came across An example of this was ken griffin the reason I did the ken griffin episode even though there's not a biography on him I think there's one that's like crappy and it's like two stars on amazon So, you know, there's people writing probably like chat gbt wrote it or something or the old version of chat gbt The new version actually the deep research can write the deep research. Hey, I use deep research every day. It's really good He talks about when he was 33 years old and ran both up john arnold tells a story on twitter And it goes viral on twitter and that's how I found it That's what sparked me because I keep hearing about ken. I was like once I read that I was like This is a founder's guy have to do it and n-ron blows up spectacularly in 2001 the day it blows up uh ken charters, uh, uh golf stream jet sends like 16 people down to houston Interviews every single person in the n-ron energy like the commodity business everyone finds out how they made money what their competitors were What worked what didn't work? Right? Then he finds the head trainer, which is john arnold and john arnold's like, uh, Ken's assistant calls. He's like hey, uh ken wants to talk to you. Would you talk to him? He's like listen, i'm not open for a job right now. I'm trying to close the books But I respect what ken has built so I will talk to him Okay, i'm headed to aspen for an event right now When i'm back in houston tell ken I will take his phone call Hangs up assistant calls back a few minutes later ken is willing to fly to where you are if he flies to aspen today Will you meet with him? He said yeah, how bad do you want and ken's point that he makes that's I don't think that's in the The twitter post but he tells that same story in the conversation with yale He goes I hired all the best people at n-run and since then we've made about 30 billion dollars trading commodities How bad do you want it? Most people like oh i'll wait till next week. I'll catch you a couple days. He's like i'm coming today 33 years old You always see the true interest is revealed early He was doing stuff like that when at when long-term capital management blew up in 98. He was 30 years old He went and visited those guys. Why what do you want to know? You guys didn't lose control of your business until over 90 of your equity How the hell did you keep it after like 30 40 50? How is that possible? And then what happened that was in 1998? He was 30 in 2008 when he was 40 He lost 50 of his equity and he says what I learned from those conversations I used 10 years later to keep citadel in business I asked sort of the marketing version of this question like the non-fiction marketing like if you believe so deeply in the thing It actually becomes easier to to sell the 600 vacuum versus the 40 dollar one What about on the talent side? I know you've learned a lot from brad jacobs and other people about the power of hiring the very best people Everybody says that like of course everybody says it but they don't do it but they don't do it So like why don't they do it? What do found true founders in your in your sense of the word do differently in the same question? Asked about marketing but for talent. Yeah, there's a great line I did this clip in this video called overpay for talent because you can't really overpay for talent And brad jacobs in his book, you know, he talks about that over and over again We me and you went to his house and he talked about he told us like numbers He was paying for talent like, you know, it would shock you Mr. V's video editor is like this 22 year old the main kid 22 or 24 year old kid Like if you knew what he paid him like you see us over and over again Why because the example in the video is like well, you know, did apple really need next? No, they need to see jobs. So they paid five they paid half a billion dollars to rehire the guy They shouldn't that they needed and he produced, you know Whatever return on that money like they got a deal on getting him back um, the reason I think people don't do is one I don't think Everything we describe and I do I think there's like a limit to like the actual application I guess these ideas you can scale down and scale up but like There's just not that many talented people in every Field and they they're really hard to find they take a long turn long time to to to usually convince They're usually really really expensive And in many cases they're working for themselves So like they're not like there's not like an abundance of people but this just happened with um me and you talked about this Your new editor in chief Just wrote that neil Made a piece and how did you find him? You found he wrote the best palmer lucky and palmer luckies the best profile period Yeah, and the best and palmer lucky is like, uh, he's got a lot of coverage He does great interviews and everything. He's wildly entertaining and yet this guy wrote the best piece on him. So it's very Jeremy stern. Thank you. It's very simple. It's like oh This is what monger told our mutual friend brent. He's like, how do you find co's? I just find somebody did a great job at being a co and said do that but for me And then brent's like what about higher potential and monger's like I don't do that I don't do that. I just find the great guy and tell him to come over here So you just did this you're like, hey that guy's really good. What's the chance that he's only able to write one good, right? Impossible. Yeah, like you don't get that good Without there's a skill there, you know And so, um, I have gone through I realized I wasn't even taking my own advice because I would use like All these people when you there's like inside baseball this like when you see all these podcasts and have all these clips they're outsourced Clip farms. Yeah, they're they're like they're like all the pitch is like it's so cheap And I even use some that my friends recommended and i'm like, these are terrible And I found a guy and we met him together And he is really young and really gifted. His name is maxim Uh, he is my opinion one of the best short form editors in the world Shut up, blake robbins for for connecting us It took me a while a few months to do this only works because he's obsessed with the podcast And he was like in the audience he's predisposed and he's already listening to it anyways And I was like do that for me and then he tells me the price and the price is like six times 6x what other people pay and I said done Where do I send the wire? Because and then and then what happens the clips are coming out and the person that's doing your video right now All these people are me. They're like, these are the best podcast clips And then we mean you've talked like what's the management? There is no management Like I I bought your taste It's like I know already know you're great because I watch your videos and like this is incredible It's like hiring tarantino and be like I have some feedback for you. No, we should shut That's tarantino. This happens to me where like I get emails and the subject line feedback on the podcast Don't even read it right in the garbage you link me to a podcast that you have made That is even in the in what like even in the same category And then I will listen But again, you think i'm making it for you. I'm making it for me The act of publishing it makes it an act of service, but I made it for me first So I can't do what you want me to do because i'm not making it for you. I'm making it for me I have to be satisfied first and so The answer question is like one even me who every single episode is like overpay for talent find the best people Never ever forget the dynamic range of humans You know, uh, steve job says, you know, the best person is not a hundred times better not twice as good There are a hundred times a thousand times better, which is obviously true Think about the best investors like you know that profile you did on neil meta Like I don't know how many other investors in the world are better than him. It's not 10 000 Whatever the number is it's a small number, especially if you you say the same age group now What five two one? I don't know But that's the and that's so hard to actually find the person in this case It came because somebody else that's really good at spotting talent told me and you about this guy And maybe I probably wouldn't have found him if it wasn't for that So these things take a lot of time and then um, what I would say is just like if you're not you have to actually actually ask yourself and I think having a um, I have a basic intolerance for Casualness for mediocrity for Not being completely obsessed with what you're doing And so that weeds out most of humanity anyways, and then what I do is like I have this this great back somewhere It's like you should limit you should limit the amount of details and then make every detail perfect And so for me, it's like I don't need a bunch. I don't need anybody to edit I don't need anybody to make it the only thing I can't do is i'll never be a video editor like him So I can't it's not like I have to go out and hire I don't want to put myself in a position where my business only works if I find like the 15 best people in the world That's not the game i'm playing. I love the answers on product on marketing and on talent. Maybe the last one is on capital Is there anything that you've seen the people that you've studied do different or special especially well When it comes to attracting the right sources and partnerships with on the capital side specifically raising money doing clever deals Clever financing is there any dimension there that's worth exploring? This is where i'm starting to get in trouble, too I talk I I literally have no friends that aren't entrepreneurs But I just can't talk to anybody. It's not an entrepreneur what I always tell them they're like Yeah, I started this company and it's like software company and they're like, all right I gotta go and like raise a bunch of money I was like you should take a look at like what larry ellison did and steve jobs and bill gates You listened to the podcast right? You told me you listened to those episodes. What did they do? They raise money No, they sold the product. They started selling the product before the product was made Well, maybe you should go out and see if you can get like other ways to do this um, it's shocking to me how the default is I must go out and Convince other people that are not my customers to give me money and sometimes you have to like there's nothing i'm not against I'm not anti-raising money. I'm anti-wastefulness and The what the the the the point that todd graves makes in the episode is like listen, man A lot of these p guys come in and they try to buy you out and everything else is just like why do you think? They want your equity because it's very valuable. So doesn't mean you can't change You know exchange money for equity. Sometimes you have to do it But you should be very very careful and he came up with like think about this this way How bad do you want it? And i'm doing the michael dell episode. I'm almost positive michael dell his initial startup capital for dell was a thousand dollars I have to double check because i've already listened to the book three times i've read it i'm going through it again So I couldn't remember me and i'm pretty sure when he went public, you know, like 70 of dell It's not my opinion. I would just go how does larry ellison own so much work all Like where did the funding come from microsoft? What about apple? Like what did they do like they obviously raise money they go public do all this other stuff Just like think about that and do you have to do that? This is a really important decision You should not be casual about what you're doing. So todd graves chicken finger, right? How many people you're going to criticize this guy for being put on this earth by god to Make the world's best chicken fingers and I love them fried chicken outside of like I like fried chicken Like I like it. I don't know what to tell you. I try not to eat it because I get fat immediately But I like fried chicken I've eaten a lot of fried chicken. I like his fried chicken. I think it's the best. So what did he do? he's like listen, I went to a bank he goes it was a the idea for recent canes was a Uh a paper in business school at lsu Uh, and he had the worst grade in class, which is funny because fedex fred smith got a Bad grade phil night nike bad grade. Maybe we shouldn't have professors judging business plans Maybe this is kind of stupid, right? so Todd graves goes I bought he goes to office depot buys a briefcase You know like the little shitty one with like the the zero zero zero like I put the brief So I buy a 99 suit. I buy a briefcase I put the I put the the the business school paper that I got a bad grade on in the in the briefcase I go down to the bank and they're like dude. We're not you're not in you're not in a position to Uh loan you money and one of the reasons was you have no experience They saw him you should work in the industry for 10 years Even though he'd already worked through it in college But you want to just make chicken fingers where your industry is going in the opposite direction And they this is where I got really pissed off in the episode. I was induced into a state of rage. They said Todd obviously this is not going to work out because look what McDonald's is doing they're going after variety. There's salads There's all these other stuff on the menu. There's milkshakes You just have chicken fingers like what is wrong with you? And my point was like that shame on that Person at the bank because again, nothing we're doing is new Go back to 1948 look up this guy named Harry Snyder who founded this company called in and out All Todd graves did if you look at what he did. He's like, oh i'll just do in and out but for chicken fingers It's the exact same story except he started earlier and is now I think when when harry Snyder passed away, he only had like 17 restaurants and and you know, todstone chargers company's got 800 and something and so like the that part like really frustrated me because it's like there's already a historical equivalent of this Succeeding beyond like your wall of streams in and out probably wasn't an lsu the guy didn't know maybe there was no internet back then Whatever the case is like i'm not like being overly harsh on this. So then what's Todd left to do? You're not going to loan me any money. What do I do? I guess i'll just give up That's what most people just stop right there. I know okay. I will work for 10 years. These guys are right I'm some young stupid college kid They're they're in fancy suits in a nice office. Like they know what they're talking about history Clearly we can see is that that in many cases is not the case. So then what did you do? He's like, okay uh these oil companies hire boil makers and What happens is if a refinery goes down Every day that thing is down. That's very expensive them So boilermakers come through and they either like update the equipment or fix the equipment And so if you're willing to work 95 hour weeks in grotesque environments in physical labor You can make so much money working 100 hours a week for like five weeks at a time Then he meets so he makes a ton of money He saves up a couple tens of thousands of dollars doing that then one of the boilermakers named wild bill Who's also one of his investors, which I love he got the money from? Saving money from boiling making right then he got Uh, then they tell him hey you can go up And do commercial fishing in alaska at the time. Todd is doing this I'm like much younger watching deadliest catch He was on like the show is being filmed when he's doing this and so yeah, you may fall overboard and die But if you don't you're gonna make you know 50 grand in in two months as a 20 year old kid And he lived in a tent. He lived in a tent. He ate nothing but ramen noodles He risked his life right on the boat. He went to the boilermaker Then he comes back the boilermakers give him a little bit money like you keep talking about chicken fingers You're fucking crazy. I will give you a little bit money Then he he had a bookie. You guess what? My bookie has a lot of cash His he has a cash business this guy does not have a bank account So then he invested and that's how he got the money to do his first store and then from there He's like, okay. Well, how do I do store two store three store four? The first 28 stores after this was financed in a very unique way Which he says this worked out for me do not do what i'm about to tell you to do They're all geographically concentrated in louisiana Right, and so he would go and he said he called him angel investors. They're not angel investors So he goes so I I I have two chickens finger stores. I'm gonna open the third I don't have any money right banks not still giving me money, right? But these things start cash flowing right away. So I go to you I go dude give me 200 grand I'll give you a one-page contract Personally liable not the company personally liable and I will pay guarantee a 15 return on this 200 grand And you say okay, you don't you give me the 200 grand I put the 200 grand in the bank the bank now will lend me that like oh you have 200 000 equity I'll lend you 800 grand on top of that million dollar, whatever the number is on top of that and I start the store And what happens? Well day one there's gonna be some people buying chicken. So cash flow happens right away I pay my rent 30 days later. I pay payroll two days or two weeks later And I pay all my supplies net, you know net 30 or net 60 And so it works as long as people come in and start buying chicken fingers And so he's like I was rolling I was balling out of control He gets the all the way up to 28 stores doing this leverage to the Is it? Yeah, exactly. Um Leverage to the hilts and then hurricane katrina comes through and goes There goes all of your restaurants. And so then he's like, oh my god I'm going to lose everything and then what happens he turns the pandemic he does this and this is what great entrepreneurs investors do They took they find opportunity and catastrophe Right. And so he's like listen guys. We have to open up one. You guys want to paycheck, right two Every single other restaurant in louisiana is closed. So people need to eat Uh three if we don't i'm done There's nothing like I I need to make money. He winds up being the first restaurant to open after hurricane katrina He had like a he had like 90 days Something like 60 to 90 days to himself. So what happens you live in louisiana? Maybe you never tried raising canes. Guess what? Now now you try it now Oh, this is really good. And now you're a fan and you tell other people and it keeps compounding same thing with the pandemic What happened all the restaurants are closed? But the government said right food is essential right an essential business But it has to be in the drive-through he went from doing something like I don't know Let's say two billion or let's say a billion dollars a year in 2020 to like five and like 2024 Yeah, so took him taking you know, something's terrible and turning it into an actual opportunity So that's like pretty creative way to finance something and his whole point is it's like yeah, or you could go How bad do you want it? How bad do you want it? And just think through what you're doing because his whole point whereas he saw a bunch of other people They they raised money and we know people this has happened to they don't have control and his his thing was he was not optimizing for money He was if it's your dream The first thing the most important thing is survival It's to make sure that they can't take your company away from you Steve jobs again this people Founders talk about this all now like this is something new Steve jobs said in like the 80s victory in our industry is spelled survival You go back and talk about like people think like he was Unbelievable. He was he said he has this line It says something like you pay attention to the nickels because the nickels turn into quarters And he says when and when he's like at the beginning of apple we paid attention to all of our costs We watched what we were doing. We we bought intelligently He would call up his suppliers and had well the hell out of them and he obviously he's Probably the best husband ever lived and then when he started next he's like, oh I didn't do it anymore Because i'm rich and I don't need to and I have ross perot writing fat checks and i'm on i'm famous and he stopped doing it He's like we got to get back to the basics. We have to be very creative and very pay attention to this We started our conversation talking about focus To conclude it. Can you just define after all this study what? That the word founder Means to you. That's a good question. I don't know if I ever thought about it. Um the way So my definition for entrepreneur has always been like somebody has ideas and does them And I think when the reason i'm interested, um we we have this thing called like the shorthand called like founder mentality and There's the reason I I profile not only just like founders but investors and athletes and filmmakers and people like napoleon and churchill Um is because what they did is like they saw something missing in the world It could be leadership and like to think about winst churchill post world war two or during world war two It could be you know A non-profit it could be a product it could be a company it could be a service and they're like this thing should exist And like i'm going to make it Come to life and the way i'm going to do this is like i'm going to direct my energy on Creating this thing from nothing and making it real and I I still think like again You know this because like you have small kids And especially when they're really small They're they have a different kind of intelligence where everything to them was a wonder and so they're constantly like why is that? Why is that my son's in this this age right now? It's just why why why why why and sometimes it can get frustrating but it's also like kind of brilliant It's like on the midwit meme. It's like all the way to the left but like really actually brilliant And I don't think I ever get over The fact that you can have an idea that you don't even know where it comes from Maybe it comes from your subconscious. Maybe it comes from a dream. Maybe it comes from god, whatever you call it And that idea just starts as an idea. It's like oh and then that goes from your mind into real life And the version of this is like it's a little disorienting to this day where I just sat in a room by myself Reading and then I spoke into a microphone not knowing what was going to happen and like that made something real That act of creation And it's the thing i'm most proud of the fact that like I was talking to a friend of mine We went on a walk, uh right before I flew up here to to meet you And I was like, I think the thing i'm most proud of in my life is like I grinded for five and a half years with like no visible like uh Progress and I didn't give up and like I don't know if I'd do that today I don't know if I would do that today and I look back i'm like you would make a lot of stupid decisions Along this way but like that is a really good decision that you just something told you you can't explain You didn't couldn't predict that like just keep going like you will figure it out. You have the self-belief keep going It's a wonderful closing thought. Uh, so cool to think about everything you've done the last I guess eight years now nine years now. I love how you close your thing by saying, you know 400 books down a thousand to go there's always a thousand to go Wonderful closing sentiment. Thanks for doing this with me
