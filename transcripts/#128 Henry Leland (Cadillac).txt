Just a quick note before today's podcast. I changed the cover art that appears in your podcast player back to the original one It says founders. I just think it looks better than the previous one that said misfits I just wanted to let you know that you're on the right feed the miss if feed is the only place we can find full-length Episodes, so that's it. I hope you enjoyed this podcast Henry Leland laid the foundation for the future American industry He had established manufacturing procedures never previously so effectively employed and took a position of leadership He was to maintain it and in the next decades would be comparable in stature with although quite different from William Durant Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan in Comparing Leland with Durant and Ford it should be pointed out that Leland's Contribution to the development of the motor car was the establishment of high standards of manufacturing Ford of course through the moving assembly line also developed standards, but for the manufacture of a cheap car He himself recognized Leland's great contribution Durant as the founder of General Motors was a promoter but made contributions as the head of an organization Offering a variety of cars and the establishment of company supplying parts Sloan reorganized General Motors on a sounder basis and established its highly successful system of financial controls The Dodge brothers would be included by some experts as a major force in the early automobile industry and in the 1920s Walter P Chrysler took a prominent place in the industry Leland's period of eminence might be set as 1908 through 1922 How had he reached this eminence? Let's go back and follow the Leland story from its beginnings It takes us first into an earlier industrial era Goes hand-in-hand with the steady rise of American manufacturing through the bicycle and the pioneer automotive stages enables us to understand more fully the maturing of the motor car in the United States and Still has relevance to the developments that are taking place today That's an excerpt from the book that I'm gonna talk to you about today, which is master of precision Alright, so I want to start there because after I took a slight detour doing a three-part series in Larry Ellison I'm back on this multiple part series on the early days of the automobile industry in the United States and every single person Listed there. I've already done podcasts on or I will do podcasts on in the future. I just had to wait for some books to arrive Okay, so let's start in the introduction. There's an overview of his personality here and I would say a brief overview of the his general life story. He's Henry Leland is the founder of both Cadillac and Lincoln so it says Henry Leland always got deep Satisfaction out of anything which was made right He had in high degree the pride of craftsmanship that had marked the master workmen down the centuries originality of conception had to be matched with close attention to practical effectiveness and Both had to be crowned with artistry of forms and so that paragraph really gives us insight into how Leland approached his work He bought he had by far the highest standards In terms of quality standards than any other early automobile pioneer It continues Leland's role was an inspiring and often a successful one He developed the Cadillac the self-starter the Lincoln car He held up high standards of performance for the industry and established the first notable school of automotive mechanics Unfortunately near the end of his life. He saw his company the Lincoln Motor Company go into receivership Eventually it passed under the control of Henry Ford who at first proposed to keep Leland and his son in the industry as a public service But in the end failed to live up to his profession to his professions I would say he failed to live to his promises the authors go fully into this painful episode as they do in all phases Of Leland's career, so that's a good overview of where we're gonna be going Okay, so I want to get right into his early life His family camp like most Americans at the time they were farmers Henry Leland transitions he the transition that happens on an individual basis in his life from farmer to to Somebody working in factories is not only taking place in his life, but in American culture at large So here the author is talking about what Henry learned from his father who was also a farmer He bequeathed a singularly Trustful disposition to his youngest son who could never believe that other men were not inherently as good and honorable as he himself and With several times to pay a stiff penalty for this faith in human nature Remember that sentence when we get towards the end of Leland's life story where he's dealing with Henry Ford and Henry Ford Betrays him. Here's a lesson that he learned from his mother. Although at six years of age at the time He already had a few duties One was to drive the cows and from the woods to the barn lot to be milked He had a small boys fear that one of the that one of the bears might come out of the woods Full of dread one evening. He threw down the poles at the gate in haste scattering them His mother appeared and called him back This is hit this is her talking to her son There is a right way and a wrong way to do everything Hunt for the right way and then go ahead Although he did not know it then this simple admonition was to become a creed that would cover all Govern all his actions later as he rose in industry So his family has really poor luck on the farm They decide that they're gonna escape the farm and they were essentially they were in perpetual. I would say poverty And so they decided to try to escape that by moving to New England where there's a lot more manufacturing that's starting to take place But every member of the family even Leland is a really young boy must get a job and continue to work So says but even he found a small job He was given the task of feeding and watering 400 chickens and of keeping separately the eggs of several fancy breeds of poultry It was a happy time. The family was reunited under one roof And so eventually he got he starts working in factories as it gets a little older and what's interesting about this time is We see the transition in in Henry's life also mirrors that the Overall transition that's happening in American life where people are leaving the farms to work in an entirely new industry he lives through the beginning of two industries in his life one is the manufacturing in general and factories and then the automobile and industry in specific the author is gonna tell us a little bit more about this time Americans of the 18th century understood how to till fields Sail ships fell forests and run sawmills, but they knew little of complex machinery or factory operations This is where Leland becomes an expert, right? Native manufacturing skills therefore were scarce and the first concern of all new undertakings was to produce experience operatives later on Henry realizes the same things is playing out in the automobile industry. So he starts one of the first schools for mechanics He's like we don't have enough high skilled workers as many that we need As the Industrial Revolution accelerated the Leland's like thousands of others who had no land and no hope of continuing in their traditional farm Life began entering these rudimentary factories and shops Some forced by the necessity of making a living and others attracted by a broadening opportunity to exercise their latent ingenuity So Henry takes a few jobs in factories. He proves himself even as a young person. He's about he's a teenager at this time He's very competent so he gets the opportunity to become an apprentice and I thought his response was interesting It says it was an opportunity but Henry Leland was not sure that he wanted to become an apprentice machinist The hours were long. He had to work 10 10 hours a day six days a week and most factories did not pay high wages Moreover farming was still the traditional American occupation which offered a possibility of independence It did not shut a man in door indoors with noisy machinery So eventually he takes the position and it says once in his new position the young man perceived that it offered many possibilities He was learning something all the time his new job held promise for the future Even the Gibbs of his older shop mates merely fired him with a determination to master his craft So what they're talking about there is he's working with a lot of Englishmen and at the time there's no there was no respect for American craftsmanship. They're saying Americans made crappy products. They didn't have the skills that all the greatest products in the world came from You know wherever Europe so they're telling a young Largely ignorant Henry Leland this and I thought this section was really interesting It was simply impossible they smugly pointed out for any Americans to achieve real competence mechanics Americans had no really skilled workmen inventors writers statesmen In fact, there were no great men but Englishmen. So that's what his older co-workers are telling him Of course, that's not true, but he doesn't know Henry doesn't have a large education at this time So he doesn't know any better. So this is where he learns the value of reading While he resented the chafing he lacked the background of reading and experience that would have afforded him an effective rebuttal so he starts he gets access to a bunch of books and This is a result Henry was already discovering the education that could be mined from books at first though fond of reading He had been attracted by cheap adventure novels, which he borrowed from the local library One night a stranger there seeing what he was taking out exclaimed surely you don't read that trash Henry replied what better use can I make of my time than to read? The stranger answered it makes a lot of difference what you read and then suggested some better books We saying, you know, you're on the right track for reading but you're just reading the wrong stuff The episode was a revelation to young Leland and he was soon reading volumes that acquainted him with American genius in literature government and invention So right about this time the Civil War is going on so it says his reading and his feeling of the necessity to defend his Country had made him deeply patriotic Abraham Lincoln was his idol. So Lincoln is named Lincoln Motor Company, which Henry founds when he's in his 70s, by the way Is named after Abraham Lincoln who he thought was the greatest person ever To ever live if we wanted to continue that conversation that Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison were having I think it was on the podcast about the billionaire and the mechanic where you know jobs saying Gandhi's the best person Ellison is saying Napoleon. Well, we have Leland's answer His was Abraham Lincoln his brother Edson had enlisted and although enlisted into the army He's a little older than then Leland Leland's actually underage at this time and although Henry was underage and his parents had refused their Permission for him to become a soldier. He determined that he would join up So he goes down and enlist but his mother follows him there to stop this So it says about his mother guessed his intention Followed him to the recruiting office and had his name removed from the role of Eligibles and then sent him back to work and his mother probably saved his life his older brother Serves in the war gets captured then winds up getting sick and dying I think he died of some some kind of pneumonia like disease And so Henry Leland survives the Civil War Because he was too young to enter in so but he's extremely patriotic and we're gonna see this later on where I'm not gonna say it's the greatest mistake in his life He's because what he wanted to do but he he quit Cadillac and resigned because Billy Durant would not let Billy Durant was a pacifist and would not let Henry Leland create weapons for use the the Cadillac factory to create weapons for during World War one and Cadillac I would say is you know, it was an extremely high quality company extremely profitable most of his life It was and he was in control of it Which that's where he runs into a lot of trouble later on is that? Lincoln was not on solid financial ground was eventually overtaken by Henry Ford and he Lacked control and so Henry Ford had all the power But the reason I bring that up is because he was guided by this I don't know. I don't know if you want to call like an internal honor He he would regardless of if he experienced a financial penalty. That's not what drove Henry Leland He wanted to do the honorable thing Remember it said his dad taught him that you know that to have faith in his fellow human beings and Leland definitely did you also See that and how he created his products, but also how he managed his company which I'll get to okay So anyways back to this patriotic time during the Civil War. He's like, okay if I can't serve as a soldier I want to serve other ways and he referred who references the job he gets later on he says I made guns for Lincoln Okay, so he starts making weapons for the Union Army during the Civil War and he's also learning about manufacturing complex machines here So says Henry wanted to work where he could render the greatest service to his country So the same thing he's doing now as a young teenager he does During the Civil War he does and during World War one, okay Yeah, he had learned that the US Armory needed expert mechanics and he had several years of experience and he had determined to help There with the war production he did so and he remained at the armory until hostilities ceased in April 1865 As he said afterward the particular lesson he learned in the armory was the value of order and neatness in a workshop So remember the title the book master of precision He means master of precision in all things including the cleanliness of your workspace, right? Everything was clean and systematic a state of affairs not common in the early cluttered factories and machine shops So the war is over. He needs a job. It says he found employment the very next day at the Colt revolver factory So he's going back to making weapons now is what was interesting is this he's had, you know Several years working in factories in New England. Then he works for the armory during the Civil War now He's working at the Colt revolver factory, but again Leland was reluctant He had he was already developing a unique set of skills, but he wasn't sure if he was meant for factory work He liked being outdoors. He liked autonomy. He liked control and as a worker in the factory, you don't have those things Now once he has his own business, then he can run things as he sees his CCs fits But at this point in his life, he doesn't like the lack of autonomy So here we see like his inner this inner dialogue that's happening the struggle of what what what am I doing with my life? One would expect Henry Leland to have joined enthusiastically in the exhilarating movement for the development of the American industry Actually, it seems not to have fired his imagination He was only 22 in 1865 and it is a question whether he recognized then the dynamic possibility of the interchangeability of machine parts To be sure precision was already his god and his personal work was outstanding But apparently he lacked any soaring industrial vision that would come with further experience The truth was that he had not yet accepted factory life as his permanent and passionate concern the discipline and subordination of factory life ran counter to American individualism and So like many people in life, especially in your early 20s He doesn't know what he's gonna do that he has a lot more years ahead of him than he does have behind him So he's testing out a different a lot of different things He's still working in the factory still he wants to buying a farm and working there on weekends He's like maybe I'll do that. He tries to study law like his idol Lincoln He becomes a police officer for a time and he also works on volunteer fire department So I thought this was hilarious. So the note of myself is there's still no grand purpose in life He's still not what sure what to do and then gangs of New York So I'm referencing that classic movie and I'll tell you why in a minute There now followed a period in which Leland was active in church and town affairs was seen to lack a sure sense of his purpose in life So he's this is when he starts volunteering for these like a Volunteer fire departments. They call them companies And there's a scene in Gangnam gangs of New York, which plays out exactly like what's happening in in Leland's This is a crazy time So it says every company meaning fire company strove to get to the fire first and each sought to wash out its closest rival So not only are the fire companies trying to put out the fire. They also get engaged It's almost like a gang and they do these At the scene of every fire. There's fist fights and brawls after every fire There was likely to be a rough-and-tumble fist fight between companies So there's a scene in gangs of New York that shows us Leland was active in the fire department for about five years Then a nervous breakdown drove him from the shop to the farm for a rest And so it's after this breakdown again. He's got a ton of anxiety about what his life is gonna be He finally figures out what he's gonna do. He finally makes his commitment So says Leland now took a long hard look at his future his mind His mind independent and teeming with ideas made it difficult for him to work with others He longed for a business in which he might put his theories to work, but he had no money He had a family to support and his father and mother were in need of aid It would be years before he could save the necessary capital to launch a business But he reflected that he could prepare himself for the time when he might Accord when he might start a business that is accordingly He decided to go into the best factory he could find and learn all there was to be learner This is extremely smart move by himself. He's like, all right, I got to commit to something I'm gonna commit to factory work and if I'm gonna commit to it, I want to learn from the masters I want to learn from the best people and in New England at the time the most precise The company that had the reputation for the highest quality work was this company called Brown and Sharp and that is where he's going to To work and it's during this time and not only we see that he's dedicated his craft But he also has a strong belief in his abilities So he's making a series of screws for Brown and Sharp right now and they're getting rejected as not being High enough quality and he thinks that's incorrect And he wants it being correct and the reason I bring this up is because this is the first time that he ever felt thrilled with his work So it says the inspector who checked the output rejected thousands of screws which Leland thought fully met specifications He studied his machines and even scraped some of them, but he could find nothing to account for inaccuracy He then examined the gauges used in inspection and was able to demonstrate that a number of these were worn in inaccurate so that the rejected screws actually met qualifications So he takes that confidence of being correct and starts to Re-evaluate the way the factory is doing certain things and realizes. Hey, there's a lot of room for improvement here He says he noted that number of parts were being made on lathes Which he felt could be turned out better and cheaper on the screw machines indeed He thought that on some items he could produce as much a day on the screw machine as the lathe could put out in a week or more Accordingly he proposed certain shifts to the superintendent who authorized him to go ahead So he's known his entire career for doing this for redoing factories Not only as a salesperson for Brown and Sharp later on but also as an engineer in his own company So it says the shift was made and so successfully by that the time he left the department He was supervising 60 machines when at first he was he had just been supervising six of them And for the first time he felt the thrill of real accomplishment in his chosen life work So not only is he improving the overall productivity of the the factory. He's also inventing new products So he invents what some consider the first elect pair of electric hair clippers and he does so after Overcoming a lot of adversity the leaders of the company push back over and over again No, we don't want to we don't want to diversify into this product line You know whether it's we don't have to dedicate the time or they doubted that they would actually sell the product becomes Extremely successful and the reason I bring this up is because it's important This is where he realizes I have to have my own company I'm not gonna be able to get my ideas out the way I want them unless I'm in control She says the manufacturer the Clippers was spirited and rose quickly to an output as much as 300 daily For this I received a thank you and 50 cents a day more in my pay envelope That was one of the times I thought I ought to quit making other men rich and go work for myself Okay, so now is the only becoming an extremely skilled machinist He's understanding how to make a factory more productive, but he's also goes out on sales calls So he goes to other factories because Brown and Sharp are producing Machines that are used in other factories, right? And so Leland was a gifted salesperson But he's not gifted the same way Billy Durant was or the reason Billy Durant was who was extremely personal positive Leland was gifted at sales by not trying to be good at sales. He wanted to educate People he was gifted at selling because he gave the customer useful advice and here's an example of that He claimed he knew he was never he never was a salesman and never expected to bring home orders He just talked about jobs and machines When he found a tool or machine not being used in the most advantageous manner He would stop and give proper instructions in some shops his advice led to a change in the whole system or of manufacturing One day he was roundly criticized by another salesman who heard him recommend a Pratt and Whitney machine to do a certain job Surely this was disloyalty this helping to sell a competitor's machine instead of his own But a year later the manager of whom he had recommended the rival machine sent for him a New building had been erected and was to be equipped with new tools and he wanted Leland's advice and recommendations from the company And he wanted Leland's advice and recommendations for the installation. So what does that mean? He trusted Leland and so now a year later He's got a much bigger job many Brown and sharp machines were ordered and so this delay would happen all the time They'd go to Henry. They'd be like Henry. We were getting all these new orders in And we don't have a record of anybody ever going and trying to sell them Did you visit this factory and Henry big? Oh, yeah I talked to them six months ago or you know three months ago or whatever it was and again He didn't view it as a sales call He he went in there trying to improve their business and sharing the knowledge that he'd already accumulated It's just a very smart move now around this time He's meeting a lot of you know successful founders and industrialists and he learned something just as he's teaching them He's learning from from them as well. And it's specifically how do I get money to start a business? So says this is the time in his life where he's like, okay I'm gonna make the jump from employee to founder as usual There was little very little money left over for saving and yet at this very time Henry Leland was more hope hopeful going into business for himself than ever before He had bought his skill and experience to the service of the ambitious industrialist of the West He's traveling all over the country Trying to sell for Brown and Sharp and they had shown him in return the financial method that had put them in business With the background of experience and only a little money as a nucleus each had organized a company and by selling stock Secured the further capital needed Eureka said Henry Leland I have found it for he had great Experience and he was sure he could raise a little money his dream of an independent business might come true after all Now this business he's not gonna start out as an automobile manufacturer. He's making he's a machinist just like the Dodge brothers he's going to make machines and products for for a wide variety of companies But eventually a lot of automobile companies and that he's actually asked to take over an automobile company because his products were so High quality and the way he ran his business and I'll get there in a minute, but for this he's got to move He's got he's gonna move to Detroit. So he moves to Detroit and raises money for his own machine shop. Okay, I skipped away head I this is something very important, but the life story of Henry Leland He had a lifetime experience before he starts his company He's 47 years old and he's been working in factories since he was let's say 17 So it says Leland located in Detroit because in that city he found the financial backing he needed So he partners up with this guy named Faulkner. They're gonna start this company called Leland and Faulkner There's another guy but I'm gonna ignore him because he he leaves the partnership later Faulkner was looking for an opportunity to invest the money he had made in lumbering We saw this in the Billy Durant story to a lot of people in Flint, Michigan made money in lumber and then they dumped it into early automobile companies Leland's compelling arguments persuaded him to put most of the money for their for a machine shop Like the rest of the United States Detroit was much taking with the bicycle craze So they start making parts for bicycle manufacturers as well The new the new firm was formally organized in September of 1890. So we're about 13 years From the from like the birth Of the automobile industry. There's of course people still making cars before this but this is when they're starting to produce thousands and thousands of cars every year now something to know about Leland is he's very much You remember Jeff Bezos told us that if you had to choose between a missionary and a mercenary You always choose missionaries because they They make better products Leland's very much a missionary. In fact, he evangelizes. He's a missionary for precision so a lot of the way he talks and some people didn't like this because He held people to high standards. I don't think he was ever trying to be disrespectful But he would evangelize that we need to do better that we can constantly improve and the products that we're making can be better So says with his own shop Henry Leland was able to organize his work and what to him was the very best way He would inoculate into his co-workers his standards of precise and planned production Many a man learned practical engineering as Henry Leland had learned it Starting out with nothing more than his own natural aptitude and some mechanical training to be progressively developed taught and encouraged by the old Pro from Brown and Sharp. That's Leland We're gonna see somebody we covered so he's Might be I Would say he's probably the most the single most influential person in the early automobile industry I'm gonna well, let me read this part to you and then I'll expound on that. Okay So it says after two years in that pioneer After two years in that pioneer machine shop one of the workmen went on to a rather fabulous career of his own His name was Horace Dodge. So he trained directly under Leland He and his brother John established a machine shop of their own furnished the first motors for Henry Ford and went on to manufacture a motorcar Which still carries the Dodge name So the I would say the reason I say he's probably the single most influential person is like Henry Ford When he ran into problems, he'd go and ask Henry Leland how to solve them Alfred Sloan dedicated more More words to what he learned from Henry Leland than anybody else in in his autobiography Same thing with Billy Durant again. He was almost like an older brother Maybe like a father figure too late He was a much older than a lot of the early automobile pioneers And as such he had a lot longer time to accumulate a set of skills that you know, they they just could not match And you also see this we talked about the difference between Stated preference and revealed preference a lot and so you see this because when they had the opportunity to go buy their own car Alfred Sloan other people they would buy Cadillacs They're clearly saying hey this person has higher standards. He makes the single best Product out of anybody else in his field as with any new business There's a lot of series of the series of struggles that Leland has to overcome and one of them is you know The they they had a lot of success because they had a great reputation right and again, they're not they don't have products yet They're still looking for products, but they're being there. They're being hired almost like contractors, right? And they have a lot of customers But here's the problem because of the small capitalization and the need for more and more shop equipment and material There were times when after the men were paid not much money was left for mr Leland the building up of a business which expands rapidly and must be financed primarily from its own earnings is often a discouraging process So Leland winds up becoming extremely financially successful, but he that was not his primary motivation in fact he got a lot of criticism because he's constantly investing in the best materials and He does this to an extreme for an example, they couldn't find a foundry of high enough quality So Henry's response is okay. I guess we're gonna have to make our own and we see Once he starts a foundry and advertises its services. We're gonna see right here How he views Remember they said precision is his God quality is his God the new foundry stated We appear this isn't the advertisement for them ready. We appeal for business only to those who want the best We do not attempt to compete with the average foundry as concern on concerns of price We believe no other foundry can successfully compete with us concerning quality For months, mr. Leland personally inspected every wagonload of casings delivered and the effort and then this is Extreme nature here and then the effort to get workmen and foreman educated to his own critical viewpoint He would throw out piece after piece for any slight deviation from pattern or form Or he would go through the foundry pick up a casing and throw it with force onto the floor if it broke It was defective if it remained whole it was satisfactory For a time perhaps half the product although fully up to the commercial standard of most foundries meaning that they would be acceptable for customers Went back for remelting So saying that what the customer would accept half of what the customer would expect Except would below the standards that Leland put for himself This went on until it began to be whispered around the works. The old man is going crazy And so his theory was that listen, there's always going to be people willing to pay for quality Do not compete on price just make the very best product and he winds up being correct So says he predicted that after the quality of his casings had become recognized people would come begging for them Even at the higher price is a quote direct quote from Leland. There was there always was and there always will be Conflict between good and good enough and in opening up a new business or in a new department one can count upon meeting this resistance To a high standard of workmanship. It is easy to get cooperation for mediocre work But one must sweat blood for the chance to produce a superior product Time upheld his judgment for when he himself needed all his foundry input output This is when he did does catalog right for when he himself needs all his foundry output and had to drop his outside customers They begged this one company begged for another year supply and offered to pay 20 cents a pound Why is that 20 cents a pound important because they previously been the founders open outside customers He was selling his casings for 8 cents a pound So this they found the quality so high that they would almost pay three times more than they were before just to not lose on Out on the quality of the product So Henry Leland is kind of pulled into the automobile industry and he's pulled in by ransom old ransom old is the founder of Oldsmobile and this is what Henry Leland learned from ransom olds Ransom old will always occupy an important niche in the automobile Hall of Fame for he demonstrated that the motor car was a practical Vehicle which could be manufactured in quantity and would attract buyers by the thousands He was afraid now he's not he was the first mass produced successful mass produced automobile manufacturer Not on the scale of course like the Model T But still selling thousands of vehicles a year it now seemed likely that the automobile industry might grow to considerable proportions Henry Leland believed that it had become that it had a great future yet He had no idea of entering the business himself So this idea this belief that it has a great future came directly because he was supplying parts for Ransom olds and he saw how fast the growth was occurring the engine intrigued him Meaning the automobile engine intrigued him as any complicated machine which he thought could be improved Now finally got to the birth of Cadillac now. This is really interesting where it come it um where its birth from before Henry Ford had two failed automobile companies before his third and final his final and successful automobile company right that that second Company which starts as a Henry Ford company eventually turns into Cadillac and this is that story the Henry Ford company So it's financed by this guy named Murphy Okay, the Henry Ford company was incorporated in 1901 and Henry Ford again took his place as an engineer Difficulties and disagreements ensued and though some cars were built Ford left the company by 1902 so he lasted less than a year He lasted the five months actually the directors had decided on liquidation When approached Henry Leland promised he would go to the plant and look over the machinery So they had Murphy hires Lienleys like hey again. This is this speaks to the reputation That that Lienlein worked his entire life to achieve. Hey go tell me what my machines my machines are worth Okay, because we're gonna liquidate this this failed Henry Ford company The fact that this young automobile concern had failed to survive did not surprise Lienlein the auto craze had fallen upon Detroit and half the mechanics of the city were concocting cars in their home workshop, so the the numbers Vary depending on when you're looking at but from from what I understand there was about 2,000 individual car companies and Almost a hundred years later only three survived So says now this is Henry Leland son talking about what's taking place at this time When father accepted the job of appraising the automobile company's equipment He must have had a further flash of inspiration some day late some days later. He appeared with a high-powered motor He was doing his own tinkering and realized hey, I actually have improved this motor I think is the best motor and maybe we should manufacture it So he goes to this meeting and they want to know how much the equipment's worth and he starts doing this pitch He's like well, why don't we? Try to manufacture his motor I can build the motor for you So he says he wasted no time in telling the men before him what values he had found in their equipment I've done what you asked me to do But gentlemen, I believe you're making a great mistake and going out of business and from there He launched into an exposition of faith in the future development of the motorcar industry his enthusiasm grew But he's an evangelist remember that I have brought you I have bought you a motor It has three times the power of the old motor meaning the ones that's in the old mobile Its parts are interchangeable and it is not temperamental So it says when he said it's not temperamental the audience laughed Why did they laugh because at this time in history most cars would fail? So it says I can make these motors for you at less cost than I make the others for the for the Oldsmobile They were sold on both the motor and the salesman the wealthy men decided to stay in business if mr Leland would join them in the reorganization of their firm. He thought he was just gonna sell motors They're eventually gonna pull him into this company and then they're gonna say hey now you're gonna pull you in this company You got to run this So when they why they're laughing when Cadillac starts going it's such a reliable motor This is where it reminds me of Henry Royce from Royce Royce who did the same thing The advertisements would say that when you buy Cadillac it comes with a round trip and the reason being is because a lot of people Would get in their cars and then eventually on their outing they'd find themselves broken down And so they couldn't get back to their their point of origin with a Cadillac you could now It's also really important to understand that a Henry Leland when he founds Cadillac he's almost 60 years old Henry Leland now embarked on the great adventure of his life He would play an important role in the organization of Detroit's first successful automobile company what that means is not only is the product Successful, but the company is financially successful I'll get to when Billy Durant buys a company from him, but they're making about I think two they're making two million dollars a year in profit and Billy Durant is able to buy the company for four and a half million dollars and even when GM gets in trouble later on He had you know Billy Durant has all these other you know Crappy automobile companies Buick and Cadillac are funding all the non-profitable companies that Billy Durant Rolls into General Motors, so Cadillac was by far if not the most successful early Automobile company one of it's one of two he's either the first or the second Buick's the other one again This is way before Ford hits the Model T. Oh And I forgot to mention something so I'm about to tell you when this is when Henry agrees to become an automobile founder He's working on the engine, but he's still running his his machine shop Leland and Faulkner so he starts working on Cadillac and he thinks it's going to be like a part-time job and Then he falls in love with the work and he realizes the opportunity so he that he winds up dedicating all his time to Cadillac So says remembering those days. Mr. Leland would say I never intended to get into the automobiles business There was too much trouble in it But to the directors it seemed reasonable that if the Leland's could do such a good job on their part of the process They could probably handle the whole operation much better than it was being done So these are you know wealthy people that made money in other domains They don't really want to run the car company nor do they actually have the skill set to do so So that's when they kind of force Leland's hand. They're like we're gonna shut down if you don't run this whole thing That's what it means that he was pulled into it Finally as the difficulties multiplied Murphy and Bowen came again to call to call to call Henry They were very definitive either you fellows come and run the factory for us or we will go out of business So the Leland's became automobile manufacturers Other men had built cars for many reasons for the fascination of creation for the profits in it But Henry Leland agreed to build a car because he did not want to see a pet engine unappreciated and unused The Leland's had agreed that they would assume general direction of the Cadillac operation and would spend at least two or three hours there every Day though still giving their major part of their day to L&F. That's his other company yet from the first day They found themselves devoting more and more attention to Cadillac and less and less to their own establishments The Leland's were happy at Cadillac Henry went to work at once systematizing the operation and winning the friendship of the personnel As he introduced his way of efficiency and ideal of precision So I want to call your attention to that that he's winning The friendship and the loyalty of the personnel that's he leaves from the front. He said later on I compare Henry Ford and and Henry Leland is oil and water Henry Leland Henry Ford was a autocrat. There was no He just he wanted essentially pegs in a machine Leland was not like that He valued the the individual contributions and he thought that if he had the highest scale most educated workers They'd make the best product Ford had a completely different approach to manufacturing So says on a dollar-for-dollar basis the Cadillac was in all probability the best car in the market it appeared at a time When there was still a premium upon reliable performance and Leland was an ex This is such an important sentence and Leland was an expert in a field where experts were still uncommon Competitors would learn they would find out by trial and error the ways Henry Leland had learned through a lifetime spent in factories among Machines, but it would take time for them to catch up So Henry's level of quality was so Was so high that He changed the perception so other countries at this time thought American mass manufacturing. They called it nasty and so Leland's Dedication quality actually changed that impression. So he insists on precision and his work The main takeaway from the sections he insists on precision and his work was appreciated because of this So it says Fred Bennett remained with Cadillac throughout his life and came to know Henry Leland well, so now He's right later in his life Bennett is writing Henry's son about his father There is one thing which I always tell present-day manufacturers and that is the real basis of the modern standard Standardized car can be put down to the strong religious sense of your father He insisted on complete accuracy in manufacturing for the reason that it would be wrong to put fine limits onto blueprints and not carry them out into the manufactured article There's a ton of examples just like this one in the book that Henry insisted on excellence from everyone around him Leland was a holy terror to automobile suppliers. So in this book it reprints The the story that that Alfred Sloan tells in his autobiography when he just he's selling bearings to Cadillac and just Leland tears into him about They're not precise enough that you can do better. And again, some people might not like to be talked that way Sloan realized invigorated him He's like wow, this guy's a lot. I thought I had high standards This guy has way higher standards and so we see that and we see the result incidentally Incidentally talking about all these like these stories get passed down about how how strict he is So it says he had spread a little farther the Cadillac's reputation for excellence So as they tell friends and other people in the industry about how relentless Henry Leland's drive for quality is All that does is it's now you have people out there saying hey this guy He has the highest quality products and this is the result when mr. Sloan bought a car for his own personal use. He bought a Cadillac This is Henry Leland talking we buy the best parts we can find I have always contended price should be considered last by a manufacturer and selecting materials for his product Now I'm skipping forward. There's a lot of it's not you know, you don't start Cadillac and then everything goes well They have a lot of sales, but they don't have a lot of like large financial backing. So then there's They're constantly short of money, even though they're making profit And so this is why they sell the GM because although they fight back from you know When there's like a financial panic, they're close to you know running out of money And then the overall economy picks up they do more sales they become more profitable and even though they're making two million dollars a year They're just like, you know, this is too this is too anxiety inducing and they thought you know The pitch from Billy to ran is that he has access to a lot more money I think the early GM was capitalized at something like 60 million dollars, which was huge at this in the early stages of the automobile industry So it says despite their present success with principle, uh, despite the present success the principal stockholders thought it would be A relief to be quit of the worry in connection with the business they had built up after so many years of anxiety and uncertainty And they were willing to sell it if they could liquidate their investment with some profit And so Henry Leland is also difficult in his dealings with Durant Durant's buying all these companies with stock And Leland's like no you're paying cash for this buddy And in this section there's also a description of like why are so many people starting car companies before they were actual manual companies And so they had a lot they realized there was a limit to how successful this business model would be But they could still make a lot of money on a small investment This is an example of that one of the fascinating features of the early automobile business was that it was possible to make so much money on a small initial investment Oldsmobile went into production with not more than two hundred thousand dollars and in less than three years it had paid 105 percent of the total And the capital the value of the stock had risen to two million dollars Henry Ford's third venture started with much less not more than twenty nine thousand five hundred dollars in cash And in four years its net profit was over a million It cost Cadillac backers one hundred seventy eight thousand for three attempts and two failures at the game before they finally got into successful production And the company sold seventy eight thousand dollars in cash And so like a lot of the people that we cover on the podcast Henry Leland thought of himself as a teacher so much that he made a school He made one of the first schools if not the first school to teach people mechanics right And this is the section I'll tell you the note I left myself after Henry Leland always wanted to share with others some of the good things he had found in life So one was his religious experience he would preach out of the Bible every every day lunch And the other was his personal experience he would teach people about the Bible And the other was his religious experience he would preach out of the Bible every every day lunch The other was his technical skill and the rewards it had brought When he went into business for himself he never stopped instructing his men in a better way to do things He labored to teach his workmen his suppliers his stockholders and even his customers he's teaching everybody around him Anybody could apply to him for advice and many did Henry Ford in the early days came over to ask him how to grind his pistons so they would not stick when they got hot So he would constantly share even though he's competing with these people he'd share his information This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by the founder of Intel Bob Noyce who's also the mentor of Steve Jobs He says knowledge is power knowledge shared is power multiplied And I think if Henry Leland had heard that quote he would definitely agree Not only did he do the school mechanics at first they thought okay We need more skilled laborers but eventually people went to school and they wouldn't even go they'd work for his competitors He still kept the school open it was very important for him he thought this opportunity was so great Because if you were skilled a skilled worker in the early automotive industry you could make a lot of money for Compared to other labor like opportunities that you had So he Henry Leland thought it was some kind of like I wouldn't say like mission But he thought he was doing a greater good by teaching people how to take care of themselves and as a result being able to provide for their families I would also say a trade about his personality I particularly admire he was dedicated to self-improvement His theory was that the one essential ingredient of success was mastery of oneself as well of one's job So now we get to the point where he's going to leave Cadillac So he's going to resign him and his son are going to resign after Durant refuses to let them make airplane engines So before Durant was true to his word he's like no no we're going to buy the company but you run it He was hands off he didn't even he wouldn't even go to the factory Leland later on in life I thought I think thought he would have a similar arrangement Henry Ford Henry Ford was not like that at all and I'll get to that in a little bit but this is where the Leland's resign Because again to him it's an honor thing patriotism and helping he thought okay if I could produce airplane engines for the war The war will end sooner and less people will die and so he thought it was a I don't know if his motivation was religious But he talked about it in a religious sense that he was saving lives that's what he believed and again he's going to walk away from his greatest professional achievement That he'll ever see and probably the best position he'd ever been in he could have probably stayed at Cadillac till you know he's in his 60s He's like 77 something like that when he when he found Lincoln Lincoln car company which starts out the Lincoln company first is organized to to produce Liberty engines for the war and then after the war is over it's repurposed into automotive manufacturing but this is where Leland walks away from the greatest opportunities life When his son returned with with his uncompromising answer meaning Durant's not budging Henry Leland blew off many months of anxiety and a mighty explosion of wrath They decided to send in their resignations to Durant and General Motors and find a way to help the war effort independently It was a heart rending decision to choose between the solid well-built Cadillac organization again probably the most successful in single brand early automobile brand at this time Combination of their life's work and nebulous so they're saying hey we're going to throw away a well-built Cadillac organization and the combination of their life work for a nebulous half form plan Meaning they don't know they know they're going to help with the war effort they don't know how they're going to do it okay it's not like they had a backup here More hope it was more hope than plan they want to build motors for the government and help win the war more cautious more calculating men would have waited until the future was more plain And the plans of the government more clearly deep defined before taking such a decisive step but the Leland's had a way of following their ideals And in this case they delayed not one moment to count the cost so there's one story from this time that I want to share with you And it gives you an insight into the way Henry conducted his life and his his relationships with other people in the fact that he was constantly trying to help people around him so at this time Everybody's trying to go after the same supplies right they need different tools they need steel they need all these the same materials because the war effort in in in America is being galvanized right And so Lincoln set up it's set to set up to manufacture engines for the war but they can't get they're saying hey they're placing orders and saying okay we need this in two weeks they're trying to give us a nine months And so he winds up getting placed at the head of the line because he wind up helping this person out in the previous time in their life so says Mr. Leland called sweet this is somebody this guy's helping him to his home and gave him a letter with instructions to deliver personally to the present president of a New England company which made a certain type of machine that he needed It was an order for a large number of machines to be delivered in 30 days sweet protested that the plant probably had advanced orders of a year or more Henry replied I know I know but just do as I tell you and then come home when the messenger delivered the letter to the toolmaker this is now the president of the company this is his response doesn't Mr. Leland know our plan is booked to capacity with orders for at least a year sweet answered he does because I told him that would be the case pondering a moment the manufacturer said go back and tell Mr. Leland he will have the machines in 30 days sweet was astonished at how much he needed to deliver the machine 20 odd years ago I had invented this machine and then used all my available money in making up a number of models these were shipped to manufacturers in different parts of the country with the request that they be given a trial if satisfactory I would manufacture as many as the company could use if not satisfactory I asked that they be shipped back at my expense with a report I soon to be given a trial and I was asked to deliver the machine to the manufacturer with such comments as no good not practical too many defects then a letter came from the Cadillac Motor Car Company over a signature of Henry Leland he wrote he wrote that he believed I had a machine that would prove of great value to the industry if certain defects were corrected he enclosed a chain of machines that were not good enough to be delivered in 30 days sweet answered he said I know I know but just do as I tell you and then come home when the messenger delivered the letter to the toolmaker this is now the president of the company this is his response doesn't Mr. Leland know our plan is booked to capacity with orders for at least a year sweet answered he did because I told him that would be the case pondering a moment the manufacturer said go back and tell Mr. Leland he will have the machines in 30 days sweet answered he said go back and tell Mr. Leland he will have the machines in 30 days sweet answered he said go back and tell Mr. Leland he will have the machines in 30 days sweet answered he said go back and tell Mr. Leland to cover the expense of my sending one of my expert mechanics to work with him and perfecting my machine if successful he concluded we will place a substantial order the defects were corrected and our mechanic returned with a good order and a check in full payment that was our beginning what you see here now is that result you may tell Mr. Leland his order will be filled and delivery made as requested and delivery made as requested and so I would summarize that section is if you do the right thing people will remember so now the war is over I'm fast forwarding and they're starting manufacturing a car now keep in mind Henry Leland is the opposite of Henry Ford Henry Ford is making a $250 $300 car Henry Leland is making a luxury product product but he wants to make the best car in the world right unfortunately this is the worst possible time to manufacture an expensive luxury car here's some details about that at any rate the advent of the new Lincoln car had been delayed almost to the very day when the economic depression of the early 20s made itself felt five days after the long heralded beauties they're talking about the Lincoln car made their debut other manufacturers disturbed by the slackening of demand announced price cuts it was a most unprosperous time to launch an expensive car no matter how great its virtues it is a high quality car but no one has any money instead of going immediately into profitable production cancellations of orders came pouring in and the company with a large and expensively obtained inventory of material in hand was forced not only to curtail its production quickly below a profitable level but also to pay out large sums in refunding deposits to dealers so not only are experiencing bad economic times but they're also playing roles they're not used to Henry is 77 when he starts Lincoln car company okay and he's doing something completely new and this is a description of that they're much more involved in the financial aspect of that and they were not really skilled in that domain the Leland's were now playing a new role one in which they had no experience and for which they had neither training nor heart remember he's 77 years old between them father and son they design created organized produced and managed but they never before been the major financial sponsors of a great business venture meaning they have a lot of their own money at stake here including raising money from people that believed in them it says previously the financial responsibility their business operations had been borne by others Mr. Faulkner had put up money for L.F. that's his first company Messers Murphy and Bowen had provided the capital for Cadillac until General Motors took over while the Leland's had started out independently in the Liberty Motor Project in the end the United States government had underwritten the operation so they're doing government contracts while they're making engines for the war so they're talking about there but in this case they have a lot of their own money in the line they're also working with people there's gonna be a split in the board right and so they're losing money they're losing money they have a lot of debt and they're all in and they have partners that are around Henry's partners are around his age right but they're getting advanced in age that their sons are now coming and other family members are now coming and involved in the business and they're they slowly convince their the older people in their family that hey we're throwing a lot of good money after bad because they get out of this they're gonna need a couple million dollars they think they'll be a Lincoln will be profitable enough Henry and his son believe that that Lincoln will be profitable enough that they can pay off the debt when the economy improves but the younger people the people that were not involved that they had no previous experience in the automotive industry convinced longtime associates of Henry to not continue to fund the company so when the company is put into receivership Ford's gonna buy it out of receivership the the final board meeting they're coming out and you know they're crying tears in their eyes because they feel they they betrayed you know the lifelong friend Henry and it just like we had to vote with my family and so Henry and his son they did not believe in quitting and so I would say this is a a an example of he had an honor Henry Leland had an honorable personality and he wanted to keep going so he could pay back to people that believed in him says manifestly impossible for the Leland's men of tender heart and unswerving integrity to take a cold dispassionate view of the financial straits of Lincoln company many automobile companies had had money troubles some had undergone a variety of reorganizations combinations and other strategies to keep alive and the directors and management had not been considered dishonest are insensible of their trust even though investors may have lost a portion or all of their equity but such a course was unthinkable for the Leland's as long as there was breath in their bodies they would oppose it they had themselves invested everything they owned in the company so even though their partners and previous financiers say okay we know we're gonna put the company we sure we give up Leland the Leland is no longer once in your ship they don't they don't own the company more right and so they're still going around there to their taking meetings in New York with all kind of bankers they're trying to find somebody to to give them money so they can get the company back and run it and then pay back their shareholders so they wind up doing a deal with Henry Ford but Henry Ford remember at this time when we covered the book my 40 years before it talked about the end of his life he was extremely uh like he was jealous he started getting jealous of Charles the author of that book was Charles Sorensen and if anybody gave if anybody received credit for anything that was not Henry Ford he found that distasteful he also refused to compromise or he was assuming rigid he's like this is you know the most arguably most successful entrepreneur in the world at time so he was not bending so and he's also known to be two-faced where he tells publicly he decides to buy Lincoln right because he does a deal because he talks to Henry's son Wilfred and the way Ford spins this is like you know Henry Leland is one of the most important people in the automobile industry Lincoln's a good car it's gonna be a profitable endeavor and I'm also doing a good deed so he's like we're gonna make money but I'm really doing a good deed because you know this guy's almost 80 years old he's played an important role and we're gonna help him that's not that's that's not true that's not why he does it he has a fanatical distaste for anybody else getting any kind of credit so it says Wilfred left this is how the Leland's the reason I need to bring this up to you right here is because Henry Ford according to the Leland's purposely misled them and lied to them and then wind up firing them later okay so this is how the Leland's thought about the deal with Ford or what he agreed to Wilfred left the Ford's convinced that the understanding between the parties were complete on all the important points they would reimburse the creditors and stockholders they would keep the distributors and retention of the Leland management right him and his son were gonna be both be running company the Leland's were believers in this case of course that the Ford offer was extremely fortuitous they were years of struggling to try to get a deal soaring defeated as they were the Ford proposal was bombed to their long tired souls it seemed logical to them that an experienced automobile manufacturer not only could appreciate the virtues of the Lincoln car and the excellence of the factory organization but also could better foresee its certain brilliant future than the mechanically ignorant money conscious capitalists of the former Lincoln directorate these are the younger people that convinced their old the older family not to keep investing money there was another bond of understanding between the Leland's and Henry Ford beside an interest in things mechanical and that and that was a certain distrust of coldly calculating financiers this transaction was to directly between father and son and father and son so you have Henry and Edsel Ford and you have Henry and Wilfred Leland all honorable men and there was no need to consider the careful dispositions of the financial world wrong wrong Henry Ford's not putting this in writing on purpose and they get an indication of this because there's a journalist it's kind of in Ford's pocket he writes for the Detroit News and he sees the one always gets like exclusives from Ford and his name is his name sweetheart swine heart and we start to see this this idea where Ford is now spinning like the publicity in the public relations of this deal the trend of swine heart story must have been somewhat of a surprise to the who believe that Ford saw good business as well as charitable reasons for investing in Lincoln company and retaining the legal management however the headline was Ford saves Leland's exactly what Ford wanted to people to believe in the gist of the announcement that followed was that Ford neither wanted nor needed the Lincoln but through the intersession of Mrs. Ford and her kind heart and because of the constant pleading of the Leland's Henry Ford's own kind heart with the Lincoln was touched and he decided to help. Okay so at this point the deal is done again Henry Ford initially agreed Leland's going to run this and then this is where we see the Lincoln organization and the Ford organizations are like oil and water just like their founders are and again as I read this section I want you to keep in mind Henry Leland is almost 80 years old when he does this. Certainly Henry Leland began his employment with Henry Ford in a cooperative mood understandingly eager for success in this last chance to save Lincoln and end his career in a successful note but he was also a man of independent spirit and he resented the contemptuous indifference of his authority the continued calculated insult to his position so he fought back so Ford sends over a bunch of guys they start like redesigning his factory they start firing people. There's no chain of command at all so he fought back he countermanded orders which had been given without his knowledge. He fired men installed in the place of his employees they'd fire Leland's employees and put in their own people and then Leland would fire them. One day when Sorensen paused, now this is Charlie Sorensen playing a like the bad guy role too, one day when Sorensen paused to question a heap of cylinders thrown aside by the inspector and after a cursory review said to the workman at hand use them, Henry came along with a sledgehammer and smashed every one of them beyond use or repair. So he's using sledgehammers breaking things almost 80 years old and he's doing that because he does his own quality like his own quality testing he's like these parts are not good enough and then his employees are saying well the Ford people told us to use it and Henry's like I don't care what they say we're not going to use lower quality products in the Lincoln automobile. So we also see a difference in management culture like I said earlier Henry Leland led from the front Henry Ford beat you down from above. So says though neither the Leland's nor many others knew it at the time this kind of behavior by Ford supervisors were not uncommon at Ford plants and with Ford's knowledge and approval so they'd hit they'd like smack their employees they'd fire them if they were just extremely I would not want to work in a Ford factory is what I'm saying especially at this time. Men were not allowed to sit down at all if they so much as leaned against the machine they were liable to be fired strange and devious ways were used to discipline men and as a quote from this other author that wrote a book on Ford he says if the work of certain clerks in the shop is not wanted why tell them so. Why tell them so I mean when you know why are we going to tell them this is they wouldn't tell them this is childish behavior I can't believe this smash their desks expensive tools of skilled workmen are scattered over the floor. This is foolish insulting humiliating not at all. This is now Ford the Ford management technique it takes to concede out of a man who prides himself on his work. I don't know what kind of quality person is going to let their desk be smashed your tools thrown about smacked in the face like this is this is ridiculous. It was such a surprise to the Leland's but it was funny to me is there's a report that is commissioned by the Ford management to like that's spy I guess to give them a report of how Leland manages and listen to the report. This is now a Ford guy describing Lincoln management the whole organization appears to us is unusually harmonious and uniformly competent. Yeah, when in that what you want. So now we get a like the contrast. It says in contrast here with the Leland's who led and did not drive with them were men many of the employees from the LNF days so people had you know working them for multiple decades, they expected to talk things over with their executives before coming to a decision. And then by the same process explained to the men under them. The reasons underlying decision which is so important we've seen over and over again we have to know people have to know why the reasons underlying decision and thus secure cooperation to the swiftly moving forward bosses such a method seem ridiculously slow and cumbersome. In fact, the whole Leland organization seemed clumsy to the Ford people. This is now the difference how they view things manufacturing was to them a matter of logistics layouts and systems, not human engineering. This is a summary of how the Leland saw this time, the whole period was to them a confusion of spit in your eye, hit and run tactics, plenty of action, but little consideration conference or explanation. So this goes on for several months. They try to talk to Henry Ford of first he's receptive he has them over to their house. And then eventually he disappears, he won't speak to them. And to me he does something that's completely dishonorable. He doesn't have the courage to fire Henry Leland. So he does. This is the order the order. There's all this infighting. So Henry Ford tells one of his lieutenants hey go tomorrow to Lincoln and tell Wilfred that we don't need him any longer. And what do you think? What do you think is Henry's response Leland's response to that's going to be, you're going to fire his son and you think he's going to. This is an honorable person. What would any honorable father do? I'm going to do exactly what Henry Leland did. He's like you're firing my son I'm gone too. And so the Ford's not dumb. He's an autocrat. He's extremely ruthless and relentless, but he's not dumb. He knew what he was doing. That's just that's just hard to swallow. So it says for a time after the dismissal, the Leland's hope to have some discussion and settlement with Henry Ford. They received two weeks advance salary as terminal pay. And that ended their association with the great Ford Motor Company. They were not to talk with either of the Fords again, so they never spoke to Henry or Edsel again. So that just seems to be like a real cowardly way to do things. And not only that, there's tons of there's a lawsuit that's going to happen. There's testimony from both sides. There's depositions. A bunch of other people that are not just the Leland family said Henry Ford made all these promises and he did not keep them. And so I want to bring up so Leland gets some money because again, Henry Ford said he was going to make all the shareholders whole. Right. The people invested and believed in Leland's. And so he doesn't do that. Henry Leland winds up having to sue the Ford Company to try to get this resolved. And I want to go back to remember that lesson he learned from his father when he was a young boy. He's now writing a letter to Henry Ford. This is Henry Leland writing to Henry Ford. Henry Ford just ignored him. Again, he never talked to him again. And this is what Henry Leland says. And so this is the final hurrah of Henry Leland's life. And he fights. There's multiple years. It goes on I think four to six years of him trying to get Henry Ford to honor his word where he said he'd pay back the shareholders. And they wind up again. He doesn't have any writing. He have promises with accountants and attorneys, but there's not. He does not have this in writing. And so Henry Ford never did. And so after four almost four years of litigation, the Leland's had to notify the stockholders that all the efforts had been exhausted on their behalf. Again, this is Henry Leland just trying to be an honorable person. And he's doing this right before he dies. He's in his late 80s at this point. So it says on September 1st, 1931, Henry Leland wrote this last letter to the stockholders, the Lincoln Motor Company. I am 88 years of age on the threshold of the exit from life, ready to meet my maker. And I am unwilling that this case be ended without my putting myself on the record. I have followed every step of this fight to obtain our day in court. To me, this case has meant the fulfillment or the failure of the agreement I obtained from Henry Ford for those individuals who suffered loss directly because of their faith in me. This suit was not brought in my own behalf for Mr. Ford paid me personally the amount agreed upon. I have brought and I brought this and together with my son Wilfred and entirely finance this suit on behalf of those others whose benefit disagreement was made. We have no further recourse to law. There is no step we can take at this time to gain for you the day in court, which every American citizen is entitled. But the equities and the Ford obligations have not changed. Henry Ford, by the terms of his agreement, owes you the amount of your stock investment in the Lincoln Motor Company. And so in response to this, a lot of stockholders sent him letters. Most of them were sympathetic and they appreciated him fighting on this. Here's one. He says, I'm just a receipt of your copy of the form letter, which you addressed the stockholders of Lincoln Motor Company. I want to thank you for it. I was a very small stockholder in your company, having invested between $1,000 or $1,100 into it. I learned to drive on your splendid car, the Cadillac, and I knew the Lincoln was going to be a great achievement as well. So I went into this with the little money I had. My father was an admirer of yours. I once met you at my father's house when I was making him a visit. I know the account of what you say took place between you and Henry Ford is true. And I feel grateful to you for the long and bitter fight you have made to have changed justice for your shareholders. I wish I could say don't worry about it anymore. I can say so for myself and I do. So, again, he's a great man. He deserved a better ending than this. One consolation alone remained. They had tried. Perhaps it had been a fragile chance from the beginning, but they had not turned it away. In a measure, while they had lost their case, they retained their reputation for personal integrity and responsibility. The business and industrial world was better for this attempt to keep an obligation, no matter what the cost and failure, ridicule and slander. But the time was not long for Henry Leland. He had fought his last fight, finished the course and kept the faith as best he could.
