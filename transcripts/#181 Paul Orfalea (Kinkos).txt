--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul says to me, hey do you want to come out with me? I need some local information about rental rates. He grabbed me because I was a student and could give him some feedback about the student perspective on renting near UCSB. So I'm driving with him and Paul is just a terrible driver. There are two sets of realtors trying to follow us. Suddenly he sees this black cat about 300 yards ahead of us. He screeches on the brakes, pulls a U-turn and goes the other way. He will not let a black cat cross his path. Then we're driving along and he sees Pardell Road, the site of the original Kinkos, which he sold to his partner. Because of that he won't drive down Pardell Road anymore. We screech up in front of these apartment buildings. I follow Paul as he runs inside. In each one he turns on a faucet, lets it run for a minute while he watches it and then asks me, how much rent do you think I could get for this place? I'd say something and he'd say, nah, and then he'd give me a number 25% above my estimate. We saw 8 properties in what had to be under an hour. The realtors are running behind us. We get back in the car. He puts offers on 6 of them and ends up buying 4. Basically, he ends up buying about $2 million of real estate in 45 minutes. As we drive back to the office, we stop at a kiosk where at that time you had to pay a 50 cent fee to cross the university campus. Paul accidentally drops a dime between the seat and the door. It must have taken him at least 2 minutes to fish out that dime. By this time cars are honking behind us. Paul finds the dime, jumps out of the car, puts it on the concrete, and then stomps his heel on it several times before he gets back in the car. I'm 19 and I'm silent. I'm completely silent. He knew I was mulling that over. I'm looking at him. I'm thinking this guy just bought $2 million in property and he can't drive down part of our road or let a black cat cross the road in front of him. Now what does this thing with the dime mean? He says to me, you know what the lesson in there is? Never lose money. All the way back I try to figure that one out. I don't know if he was pulling my leg or if he was extremely superstitious or just plain psychotic. Paul had some unusual ways of attracting talent but it worked. He got my attention. So did the company's financial performance. I was the shipping manager and my job was to send out all the profit and loss statements to each of the stores every month. I mailed them to the approximately 80 stores we had at the time so I saw how well the company was doing. I became a partner in the organization with 5 stores in the Bay Area and I eventually sat on the board of directors. I was with the company for 20 years. That was an excerpt from the book that I'm going to talk to you about today which is Copy This, How I Turned Dyslexia, ADHD, and 100 Square Feet into a Company Called Kinkos and it was written by the founder Paul Orfala and his co-author Ann Marsh. This is another book that I wasn't aware of. More than half the books that I'm covering on the podcast are coming from listeners so please keep the book recommendations coming. I read this book and then the second recommendation was another book written by Paul that was it's like a almost like a hundred page like Cliff Notes version of this book I would describe it as. It's called Two Billion Dollars and Nichols has a fantastic title and the reason it's called that is because the Kinkos would sell copies for five cents at five cents each and Paul winds up selling the business for about two billion dollars. So I want to start with the description of Paul and the reason behind writing this book from the co-author as you could guess from the excerpt we're not dealing with a normal person he's a crazy misfit and there's just going to be a lot of crazy stories in the book and just he has an entire chapter let me give you an example he's an entire chapter called Deal With Your Dark Side and it's all about the mental problems he has all the mistakes that the stuff he admits to you there's just very few people on the planet that would voluntarily put this into writing all the deficiencies that he has and I think that's part of what makes the book so interesting is because he's clearly an extremely flawed person he knows the flawed person and yes yet he still was able to build a wildly successful business so this is his co-author she says Paul is definitely not a resident of the linear world I've never met a more circular out-of-the-box thinker I'm often exhausting it's often exhausting trying to keep up with him but as I've discovered it's worth the effort because he isn't a very important story to tell it's important not only for business people and entrepreneurs who will benefit from his unorthodox and inspirational teaching but for kids teachers parents and parents struggling with learning disabilities that is what this book is about it's the story of how Kinko's came to be and the record of the peculiar genius behind the company and that's a huge part of Paul's story his entire life everybody tells him you're an idiot you can't read you can't write you're gonna be a failure and he just refused to believe that this is an example or a little description of some of the stuff he went through in his early life of the eight schools my parents enrolled me in four expelled me my typical report card came back with two C's three D's and an F I graduated from high school eighth from the bottom of my class of 1200 frankly I still have no idea how those seven kids managed to do worse than I did and the very next line we see the contrast between his record in school and his record in life my name is Paul Orfala in 1970 I started a copy shop in Santa Barbara California in an 8 by 12 foot storefront next to a hamburger stand I called it Kinko's after the nickname college friends gave me because my kinky hair today there are more than 1200 Kinko locations across the globe and revenues from those stores topped two billion dollars annually more than a hundred of my earliest co-workers and partners are millionaires today because of what we built together and so that stark contrast really does set the tone for the entire book because he's constantly talking about other people might describe it as a disadvantage other people think you might fail but you can flip those into opportunities he talks a little more about that that now when tearful parents come up to me to talk with their child's learning disorder I asked them oh you mean his learning opportunity what is your child good at what does he like to do when I meet their kids I tell them you're blessed it's easy to forget that part of the equation in the face of a dire sounding prognosis so he goes to task on the way teachers and principals talk to him and his family when he was younger he thinks they're doing a lot of damage by trying to make everybody be the same he's a misfit 100% I didn't know it at the time that I opened my first Kinko's but there's a long history of innovators and achievers who were their particular brilliance at least in part to their deficits and he's putting deficits in quotation marks some of these people make up the ranks of some of the most successful and inventive members of our society they have for Millennials so he goes on to name people from history that that would be there had some kind of deficiency Da Vinci Churchill Einstein Disney he says a startling number of successful business people have dyslexia Richard Branson telecom pioneer Craig McCaw Cisco CEO John Chambers broker brokerage founder Charles swab IKEA founder Ingvar Campra I've done a podcast on a bunch of these people I'm in good kind this is his main point here I'm in good company all of these innovators survived an educational system determined to make them feel like failures some of my closest friends were social outcasts some of them did end up in jail and I could relate to them all so I'm gonna move through the book chronologically but it does not go in chronological order the co-author described him as a hurricane I think that's a good way to think about at least the way he comes off in his writing this is he's now flashing ahead and way ahead in stories talking about the way he managed and the fact that he took the fact that he couldn't read and that he couldn't sit still and use that as to his advantage so he was a big he's a big proponent of management by walking around he's like I'm not sitting my office I'm out in the stores I'm on the front lines he constantly talks about that he he works for the people that work on the front lines he does not like the executives in fact he wants fighting and yelling at a bunch of them which I'll go into some crazy stories about that as well but he says anybody can sit in an office thinking about what people are doing wrong my job was to get out and find what people were doing right and then exploit it then I would spread those practices throughout the Kinko's network I also and then again he talks about it it is deficiency I also have no mechanical ability to speak of there isn't a machine at Kinko's I can operate I could barely run the first copier we leased back in 1970 it didn't matter all I knew was that I could sell what came out of it and so the importance of sales and marketing he'll talk about over and over again he really identifies as a peddler and you know that's a that's a that's a that's a craft or a job that goes back for centuries he comes from a giant Lebanese family all of them had businesses whether they're selling women's clothing vegetables cars it doesn't matter they were taught the value of sales of paying attention to your customer and then paying attention to the cash that the and so Paul takes a lot of lessons that he learned from his giant loud crazy family that's his description not mine and applies them to Kinko's this is on him on not hiding your flaws and then the impact of his mother so it says my hope is that anyone who picks up this book will come away with new insights into how to better run their business and to cope with and capitalize on what other what others consider their flaws in case I haven't made it clear I'm extremely human I struggle with my temper my dark side as I like to call it the dark side of the Kinko story is that the company was built at least in part on emotional extremes most of them my own so he talks about having a problem with self-control that he's an extremely gregarious and outgoing and caring guy that can flip at the end it's almost like bipolar in a sense where he has this one like extremely light side of his personality and an extremely dark where he you know he's cursing at you he's yelling he's ripping things off the wall and he doesn't recommend that he talks about being embarrassed by it and something that's slowly over the he ran Kinko's for three decades before he sold it he's like you know the way I was in the let's say the 1980s is not the way I was in the 90s although he talked before he winds up having to seek professional help and get on medication that's the only thing that solved his problem he said building an entirely new sort of business from a single Xerox copy machine it gave me it gave me the life the world seemed determined to deny me when I was younger and before I go into I want to pause here just before I go into he also had extremely positive a role modernist mother and what he just said there the fact that I could build an entire business for myself from a single Xerox copy machine I could work at it every day for three decades and then sell it make myself extremely rich all the people that work for me extremely rich that is why one of entrepreneurship was one of the greatest human inventions ever because it's open to everybody that doesn't mean everybody can like I don't think everybody obviously should be an entrepreneur but anybody can it's not like there's not nobody can stop you but yourself and so think about the the alternate life as we go through this podcast think about the alternate life path of Paul he was not going to get a job I mean the guy got fired I'll go into detail he got fired from every job he had flunked out of school but the fact was that he he had value and service that he could provide to others and as long as you have value and service you can provide to others people were willing to pay for that value and then you can keep doing that and keep improving and make it bigger as big as you want it to be or as small as you want it to be and he actually created his entire life that was denied to him by everybody every other authority figure besides his family telling him you know you're just a loser kid you're stupid get out of here I had my mother to think for encouraging the development of my own view of the world so he talks about one day she was he was expelled when he was 13 and the principal just you know tells her his mom that you know maybe he can he can find some other kind of work maybe he can learn how to lay carpet or do something else that doesn't require reading and her his mom is just crying and she's like I know Paul can do more um and this is what he says my mom dreamed her own dreams you could say that exactly for him he dreamed his own dreams she never relied on the bleak assessment of others whenever I felt down I'm not even this is still the introduction how many times has he compared and contrasted the way he felt the way his family felt to the way the outside world felt that is so important because that's the only thing that matters uh Andrew Carnegie in his autobiography talks about uh the the way you view yourself and he calls it something like the supreme judge within but what he was the point he's trying to make is that how there's no fooling yourself you know uh what you're qualified to do you know if you're putting in the work that you need to do and so all you need to worry about is making sure that you're not relying on the judgment of other of you by others but of how you judge yourself and I think Paul's echoing that here uh let me go back to this sentence uh whenever I fell down whenever I started wondering what homeless shelter I would die in she would buck me up and uh buck me up by telling me you know Paul the a students work for the b students the c students run the companies and the d students dedicate the buildings and that's remarkable if that actually is something she said to him because he winds up graduating with the average and then he does wind up having a building dedicate I think he donates like 10 million dollars to and have it has a building named after him at the university of santa barbara uh this is he picks up on he's got again a lot of just really practical knowledge about the world that I think is the value in this book um and he talks about there's a difference between good being good at school and being good at life and it's a lot easier to be good at life than it is to be good at school and he says the education system teaches kids they have to be good at everything but out of the classroom I found this just isn't so adults have a much easier time they get to specialize they get to pick one thing it's a whole lot easier so this point is like if you're good at one thing in his case he was good at building a copy and printing business he didn't have to be good at algebra physics history anything else but he provided a service and he also has a great philosophy and I'm going to run over my future point that I love that the the culture behind kinkos he says listen we had fun they call themselves capitalist hippies um but he's like we had fun with everything else the only thing we took serious is the service we provided to our clients and then everything else of that we we laughed and joked and had a great time but I love the idea behind what he's saying here pick one thing pick one thing and be better than anybody else is at it and he had a lot of competition you know anybody at this point you can lease it was like a thousand dollars a month something like that to lease a copy machine which is you know brand new technology at the time and so he had a bunch of competitors that he had to battle through most of which most of which most of which went out of business this is more about his early life and jobs in my family we were all peddlers I found your average street peddler has more business sense than the guy walking past in a suit they deal with customers in real time and get instant feedback from the market so that's something he talks about over and over again that it's very easy to sit in office away from the front lines away from the customers and come with all these theories but he's like you're just you're just using your imagination if you just go and talk to customers and try to sell them something they're going to give you the most valuable information in the world I was working on my father's clothing factory my job had been buttoning up the dresses after they were steamed but I really wanted to start assembling orders for customers so his aunt was overseeing this part a lot of his family works together and so he he goes to try to switch his job and it says she spotted me trying to pick orders and shouted at the man helping me don't let him do that he can't even read I walked out of the factory that day and sat in my car in the parking lot I cried for hours I remember thinking that it was no use trying to please anyone else it simply wasn't possible not with my skill set so I might as well try to please myself and that is something that I love about reading all these biographies because you know these people build giant companies a lot of people we cover are super famous or they're historical figures and yet the way when you read their own words they all go through periods of this this is what when you listen to like interviews with people that are still alive today still operating companies like they're incentivized to lie you know oh we're crushing everything's good everybody says the same thing but when you pick up the books you realize no that that's not the the lived experience of anybody everybody's going to go through this time this he's constantly fighting in this book to deal with his emotions to deal with a setback and just realizing okay that's fine I'm gonna cry I'm gonna sit in my car I'm gonna cry for a little bit but then I'm gonna try again tomorrow and I'm gonna make some progress and then I'm gonna run into a I'm gonna run into a setback I'm gonna be down on myself maybe I'll have go have a drink maybe I'll just take the day off and wander around but I'm not going to stop and reading stories like that just fires me up all right it took me it took me a lot longer before I actually succeeded in doing so my dad eventually kicked me out of the company so he gets another job I was serving ice cream a couple of days into that job I was fired then I tried to work at a local gas station I'm just giving the highlights here he's fired from that job as well delivering newspapers painting none of this is going to work out so says it didn't take me long it didn't take long for me to conclude that I was basically unemployable the only hope for me was to go into business for myself okay so I want to fast forward he's in college they're working on a group paper he's at University of Southern California and his job is to go make copies and to turn the paper in you know again he's not going to be reading he's dyslexic so this is where he actually gets the idea for kinkos and it's small it starts it starts as a very very small idea and I'm going to tell you how this this made me think of the new life myself is one of my favorite quotes from what is if you only going to read one book and I hope you read obviously dozens of the books that we cover here but it would be James Dyson's autobiography it's hard to find hard to get constantly out of stock but it's something you can read in a weekend and it's all about the value of stubbornness and perseverance and it's just a really fun interesting book to read but he said in that book he's like listen people like put barriers in front of themselves and one of them is like I don't know how to do what I want to do and his point was like you can always learn you have time to learn the technology later his first vacuum cleaner he built out of sear the improvement to the Hoover vacuum cleaner that he wanted to that he thought was just a piece of junk and let him down this path that he that like his career path that he's on it was built out of cereal packets and masking tape long before I understood how it worked and this we're gonna see same example here he goes to make copies he says I went to the university's copy center this is in LA okay I saw something far more interesting the copy center itself this is the spring of 1970 and people were scurrying around making voluminous copies of legal paperwork for the trial of Charles Manson I came running back to class nearly out of breath I had to talk to Danny so this is one of his best friends at the time and he says as Danny remembers it this is Danny now the quote from him Paul was shaking all over he told me Danny I've got this great idea I realized I could start a copy shop myself and I always knew and I knew a place that needed one my girlfriend at the time was a student two hours north of Los Angeles up on the coast at the University of California at Santa Barbara there weren't any copy centers there for students or faculty I didn't write out a business plan or study the market but my gut told me I could make money selling what came out of those machines it didn't matter that I had no idea how they worked and he moves on this right away so he sees that by the fall of 1970 he set up and he says I rented a small small storefront near the university there was only 100 square feet the rent was 100 a month the place was so small by the time we needed a second cop a second machine we had to lug it out on the sidewalk yes customers made their copies outdoors I was 22 years old so the very first day their first order I think is like $50 so think about his entire rents 100 bucks and you have a professor that comes in that's all he's anxious he's upset and he Paul really hits on something that's smart here he understands that he's what he's actually selling it's not that I'm selling copies I'm selling a way to relieve your anxiety people in general especially at this point in time are stressed out about technology this is not a very different insight if you think about the way Steve Jobs talked about how people approached personal computing for the very first Apple computer or how the book on Johnny Ive that we just did where he talks about you know I'm I love designing computers are becoming a huge part of this but I'm frustrated I don't think I know how to deal with them and then he sees an Apple way before he works there he's like wow okay this is simple this is now like he was able to calm down and his anxiety was relieved and so this is what Paul realizes about this professor he says like each and every one of the subsequent millions of customers we would serve over the next three decades he was stressed out and in a hurry it was a state of mind all of us at Kinko's would come to be immediately or excuse me intimately familiar with later on we would learn that we weren't so much selling copies as we were assuaging anxiety and right from the very beginning we see he's got a very again when you read these autobiographies of founders you're essentially downloading their philosophy on how to run a business right there's no formula the idea is take a bunch of ideas from other people combine and make your own unique philosophy because there is no single right way to do it and so he's gonna he's got this idea that's really really unique and one you should know about Paul he tries to get out out of as much work as possible he's not working nights he's not working weekends he's always thinking about the business but he makes sure his physical body is still there for his family he doesn't have a family this time he's still a college kid so this this is many decades in future but one of his ideas is that you you have to ask yourself if you're in or on your business and so being in your business is like you're so mired in the details uh you're not running your business your business is running you and therefore you're not thinking clearly you're not doing any his whole thing is like you need to think harder before you you can work hard but you have a lot of people work hard never think hard it's more important to think hard and then work hard but if you're on your business you're not mired down in details you can see where the business is going you can make better decisions and he talks about the time invested in thinking yields more leverage for you than just doing an extra print job right and so we're going to go into the difference he's going to bring this up in many different ways and so another good thing about this book uh he had just like i love i'm a sucker for aphorisms and maxims he thinks in maxims and aphorisms very much like charlie monger in fact in the back book the last like i don't know 10 pages are just aphorisms on how we think one sentence is like one sentence maxims on how he thinks about businesses so one of them is you know make sure you're on your business not in your business so he says as soon as i could i had to turn tedious tasks over to others and pay them well for doing them i could not let myself get swept up by all the monotonous busy work that comes along with starting a company i was already vowing to stay on my business and not in it he talks about his dad he he learned some of this from watching his dad do things the wrong way he was just always mired couldn't make any progress uh but this is the reason i'm going to skip over that part and this is the reason i learned to turn a lot of busy work over to other people that's an important skill if you don't develop it you'll be so busy that you can't get a free hour a free week a free month to sit back and think creatively about where you want to be heading and how you're going to get there when your mind can break free of all that worry and clutter you'll find yourself coming up with the most improbable and inspired ideas and one thing he really likes he really likes sales and marketing and he really likes getting other people to do the work i didn't spend much time in the store now you may not believe that but it's true when i started the original kinkos i was still a student two hours south in los angeles i stand in santa barbara for a full week when we opened the store but after that i only worked there two days a week i hired people to run kinkos for me and i left it in their care as a result there was simply no way to become too bogged down by lots of busy work one day or excuse me on days i was there i rarely made copies or work behind the counter what i really enjoyed was getting out and meeting people in a word marketing i went around campus handing out flyers there's no better way to stay on your business than to think creatively and constantly about your marketing how you are marketing who you're marketing to and always how you could be doing a better job at it you'd be amazed what kind of business you can generate by seemingly simple things so he talks about this over and over again i forgot i think it might have been worn buffet like don't dismiss uh just a simple uh i don't remember the exact quote but i want to paraphrase the meaning it's like don't dismiss a simple action as not being effective he said it a lot better than i just did because it's not i don't have it in front of me but he talks about you know we built we started building the business just going door to door essentially handing out flyers on college campuses kinkos now well i guess it doesn't even exist it's like fedex office but for the first maybe 10 years of its life it is going to be anchored around college campuses they eventually make the transition to serving more of the corporate world to get and one of the reasons they did this is because it gets away like the cyclical nature of revenue if you're only like during the summer making no money because school's out but he says you'll be amazed at what kind of business you can generate by seemingly simple thing like handing out flyers i also sewed pens and pencils out of a backpack um no this is funny so he stores a backpack and then he goes and sells oh i should i should back up so he's selling he knows he's gonna sell copies they start printing they start selling pens he essentially uses for stores a giant experiment he's like i had four or five business lines in there i wasn't sure which one was going to work whichever one generated the most revenue we doubled down on so most of that is obviously going to be copying printing uh so i also sold pens and pencils out of a backpack out in front of the store on the sidewalk by just talking to people passing by when this form of guerrilla market produced results i expanded our use of it so he talks about he then he goes and hires a bunch of students and they're now selling pens and paper and advertising kinkos door to door they just go knock on people's dorm rooms we also targeted targeted the faculty by going into their departments and pretending we were supposed to be there we stuffed flyers into the mailboxes of most of the professors on campus university professors later drove some of our highest revenue businesses and now he's going to flash forward memory he just told us his first story he's telling us about this then he goes ahead in the story like he does it's this hurricane paul and this was hilarious to me i don't know why but you can summarize it by saying be inaccessible some years later when we had a few stores up and running i made my mind to be truly inaccessible i happened to be sitting in my office uh that day when the phone rang it was one of our store managers calling to ask me how to handle a bounced check i held the receiver away from my face and looked at it flabbergasted if and that's just i it was funny because i could picture that my mind him doing it but it's his insight here is he's 100 correct if every store manager needed my help to deal with a bounce check then we really had problems i made up my mind then and there i wouldn't be picking up my own phone every five minutes staying relatively inaccessible was the only way to stay on my business and so we're still in the chapter about staying on your business with everything relates what i'm telling you everything relates to this idea of don't get mired down you're the one running the company make sure that you're actually running it it's not running you that you're thinking long term that you're coming up with the very best ideas you do like you can i would summarize this next section that you can work in sprints like larry ellison study competitors like sam walton and invent and wander like jeff bezos and those are all insights from past podcasts i did on those three guys multiple i think i've done what like four or five podcasts on jeff bezos now two on sam walton and three on larry ellison if you haven't gone back and listened to those i worked in cycles spending roughly three weeks on the road followed by three weeks back at the main office i visited different stores i also visited as many competitors as i could since the fact that they existed meant they were doing something right that sounds just like sam walton i wanted to find out what those things were they got me away from the main from the main office so i could leave people alone to do their work because the best way to show people you trust them is to leave them alone equally important i found that leaving headquarters got me away from the mundane daily grind that left no space for insight inspiration or innovation instead of chief executive i preferred the title of chief wanderer and i guess now is a good time to talk to about this just bizarre this bizarre uh organizational structure of kinkos they're all individual partnerships so you know you think you start a company you either the company either owns open new locations either you own it or maybe you have a franchise model he didn't do either of that some of them he owned 100 but he had by the time he sold it he had 127 different partners all of them were individual partners partnerships so in some cases he might earn 30 so maybe there's one store and he owns it with one guy right and he owns maybe 40 and the other guy on 60 and sometimes he there's a series of partners they all own maybe 15 in the store but they own 15 of 10 stores and it was so cumbersome that they had to hire once they they they get bought out before they get bought out they had to uh they had to hire a series of attorneys and some venture capitalists help them with this but they had to go through and roll everybody up into one corporation so you can actually sell the corporation um but the reason i bring that up is because what he's saying here is like i'm a chief wanderer he's not it's almost like he's it's very like analogous to what nature does right it's just there's no top-down hierarchical systems in nature it's a bunch of there's millions of different experiments and all those experiments result in different slightly like slighter variations or different outcomes right and so what what what paul did it was actually really really brilliant he's like okay i'm going to do a light hand from from central hq and tell you you know this is basically what we do here but you come up with the best way to do it then he's traveling around observing all these good ideas and then he'll pick up a good idea say in toledo and then he'll go back to california and give it to the california stores or he'll go down to florida and do it there but he's allowing this like hotbed of experimentation they talk about you know one time in the book i don't think i'm going to cover this later but one time in the book he's he's traveling with some other other from other partners of his and they come up with a great way they sum up a story that has like just the greatest way they've seen so far to organize the workflow of kinkos and his partner asked him like why don't you mandate instead of telling people this idea like why don't you mandate every story looks like this and paul said something it was brilliant he said because if i do that this will be the best it ever is and what that comment tells us is there's always room for improvement again there's just a lot of practical like simple knowledge is the way i would describe this book it was very very fascinating the way he thinks and again it just comes from there's no theory it comes from three decades of trial and error and i think that's the most valuable knowledge you can tap into so now we're getting into the a lot of the he talks about like his brain like your brain being your own adversary like you just can't figure something else maybe you think it's impossible and really i would i would um this reminds me of charlie monger's idea invert always invert and so he realizes i don't want i don't want he he's not thinking about what he wants he wants he's thinking about what he wants to avoid he's like i don't want only one store one particular effective way of saying on your life is to envision the kind of future you do not want in my mind's eye i saw this scene unfold the parents of incoming freshmen take a tour of their old alma mater look poly one dad says there's kinko he runs kinkos or he runs kinkos copies there i sit my curly hair shot through with gray i wave back at them that's not where i wanted to be in my old age but try as i could i couldn't figure out how to open another store so he can't figure it out he's got what's the equivalent of i guess writer's block but for your mind right so he's like all right i'm out of here dad used to tell me so he talks about again contrasting like what his dad did with okay i gotta avoid that mistake they go him and his his dad before he's born his dad and his mom go on this long vacation he says he used to tell me that was one of the few times he got a proper perspective on his life he finally had time to think he never gave himself another trip like that so okay i gotta avoid that so he thinks traveling is a way to find perspective so his business is up and running two years later they don't have any i don't i think there's only one store at this point so he takes off to go backpack in europe he says i left kinkos in the care of my co-workers for a few months while i took off on my own i guess i should pause there he does not use the word employee he does not believe in the word employee everybody's a co-worker if they have he does profit sharing he does a lot of like a lot of interesting things so his partners are called partners everybody else is called a co-worker all of them have ownership in the profits of the business so he says and it was backpacking around europe was highly motivating i became ambitious again so he talks about he's extremely poor he's like i watched vacationers strolling in and out of five-star hotels in paris and malone and he just he says i could not imagine how what how is it possible they could afford those rooms and i think that is a very common experience for entrepreneurs i remember listening to mark cuban talking an interview one time they used to drive around he's really poor i think he's running like a bar in college and he would drive through and just look at these like 20 000 square foot houses he's like what do these people do so we're seeing a very similar experience that that that paul's having it's like i'm you know i can barely keep this tiny little 100 square foot company open like i can't imagine ever staying in a five-star you know restaurant or five-star hotel in paris and you know a few years later this guy's gonna be worth hundreds of hundreds of millions of dollars it's high it was highly motivating i became ambitious again that's what a little perspective can do for you i started to envision how i might open a second store i can't even tell you exactly what changed my mind my thinking just unstuck itself and so he's giving now direct advice to the reader do what you need to do to get some time off let your soul catch up with your body it could change your life so i'll tell you his idea of really paying attention incentives is what i would call this but first this is the best definition of management he's ever heard it's a really good definition he says my wife gave me the best definition of management i've ever heard she said the goal of management is to remove obstacles it's a good way to think about how this guy manages now he talks about the difference between employees and why he wanted to to make sure he provided ample financial incentives for all of his employees i don't want employees some of the definition one of the definitions of that word employee is to make use of i didn't want to use people i wanted co-workers who would be empowered entrepreneurs who try to instill a sense or excuse me we tried to instill a sense of entrepreneurship in all of our workers one very important part one very important way we accomplished this was by giving everyone a share of the profits from the stores this is why he said at the beginning you know hundreds of people have been millionaires off of the business they built i wanted to work with people that i made money with in the best single best book you can read about the importance of that incentive structure if that's something that you might want to consider i was going deep this is like when i back when i read every single warren buffett shareholder letter i read like three or four books on charlie monger i've done podcasts on this this is like from the 80s to like around in the hundreds in the episode numbers but something as a result of reading and studying more buffett charlie monger deeply is they talk about constantly the operators and the entrepreneurs they have they respect and they led me to a bunch of people that i read books on so i want to read this quote from charlie monger he said this back in 2004 at a birkshire meeting and he says if you want to read one book that will demonstrate really shrewd compensation systems in a whole chain of small businesses read the autobiography of less swab i covered this it's called pride and performance keep it going is the name of the book it's founders number 105 if you haven't listened to it read the autobiography of lush swab who had a bunch of entire shops all over the northwest and he made a huge fortune in one of the world's really difficult businesses by having shrewd systems and he can tell you a lot better than we can and you know he was an orphan i think he starts the tire center you know you got plenty of competition he starts it with like 3500 bucks when he's like 35 years old or something like that over the next couple decades he winds up building this gigantic profitable company if i remember correctly every store he'd split like 50 of all the profits with the people that worked in the store so this is an idea that that different people in different industries have used in different times of history whenever i come across that i have to bring it to attention because that's like it's like a siren should go off red flashing lights in our minds like hey this idea can work in a lot of different domains we might find it useful let's remember it and just i love people like lush wobble he reminds me very much of like paul it's just like this no frills business just take care of employees focus on uh like the service you provide your customers and don't over complicate things and i love that because i think a lot of people just all human it's human nature to over complicate things and when you see the way these these guys these people approach their businesses it's just like all right this is simple i can understand this i can wrap my mind around this and now i didn't even just turn the page i didn't realize i'm gonna run over another i mean i just talked about how they keep it simple he says our plan for expansion our expansion was a pretty simple one i got the idea for how to grow by playing the board game risk when i was a kid in risk the object of the game is world domination playing the game taught me there was no reason to expand in a neat geographic progression in fact we didn't need to respect geographic boundaries at all so that's something he talks about a lot he'll learn uh business business lessons from games that he applies in real life so he learns lessons from playing poker from playing monopoly from playing risk and the note and the note i left on this page is there were about five years in they have 15 stores at this time and no master plan they're just taking it as it comes another thing paul talks about over and over again is the importance of saving money being frugal he says we were really frugal we i would sleep excuse me we talking about his partners at the time and him we'd sleep in our cars to save on hotel rooms he continues that trade he made not only does he have that trade but he wants to make sure all his partners have the trade he says i would never do i'll never do business with people who can't save money spenders won't be cautious with their store profits so the importance of saving avoiding debt being frugal he talks about it maybe a dozen times in the book in different scenarios paul also in addition to like putting all his like warts and ugliness of him out in the book talks about you know i have adhd i have dyslexia like he's gone through just tragic tragic experiences his life when he was younger he was molested he was kidnapped and molested uh i think by an older neighbor um this at this point in his life his first child dies and it's just fucked just devastating i just couldn't i'm gonna read this to you just so we understand who this is a person it just it kills me when i read stuff like this our firstborn son ryan died of congenital heart defect some things you just never really get over you just try to come to terms with them ryan was seven months old and had been doing well when he died unexpectedly we were with him long enough to know that he was a special boy we still keep photos of him in our house it's just i have you know my son's a little over a year old a little over a year old and it's just it's just devastating reading stuff like that moving on there's a great quote uh from nival rabakam that he says like there's no skill called business i would add this these few sentences i'm going to read to you i think that's a good way to think about this it's really all service and anyone can learn to serve our first partners and our first co-workers weren't business majors they weren't even particularly interested in business this is fine by me we had biologists philosophers psychologists english majors and lawyers we had more degrees at kinkos than a thermometer he's got another great aphorism about are we looking at our customers or as our customers and so his whole point is like you always should be looking at things from your customer perspective he talks about most businesses we've talked about this it could all be so simple start with what's best for the customer work backwards right most companies most businesses don't do this because they look at it from their perspective the only thing perspective that matters is the customers so he says i never walked in the back door that was used by my co-workers i always walked in the front door so i could see things from the customer's perspective and then he talks about there's hidden little actions that people do as a result of not looking at things from the customer and this is where some of the times he flips out on his partners his co-workers everything else because of this he has a he's maniacal about looking at things from the customer perspective and this is just really really smart because a lot of the the the cost to a lot of these actions you'll see um that businesses do i just went through an experience like this and i'll tell you about a minute they're hidden and that's his point it's this is extremely wise what's about to happen here some of our partners created an inhospitable climate for customers some posted negative signs at one store a manager hung a sign warning customers that they would be charged a steep fee if they bounced a check it said the bank doesn't make copies and we don't cash checks that really got me boiling i jumped up on the counter and ripped it down as customers and co-workers looked on amazed they may sound extreme but i needed to make the point in a memorable way i didn't want signs like that staring our customers in the face i told our co-workers that the occasional hit we took for a bounce check cost that's the most important part of this entire sentence customers didn't need to be reminded not to write bad checks especially when as we knew they were stressed out and anxiety written to start with i noticed the managers had stopped putting out little freebies customers love so much the paper clips and the pens but the customers steal them my partner complained of course they do i said and so let's go back to that point that it it talks about an occasional hit for a bounce check costs far less than what we lost and couldn't quantify i had to pick up like two you know the um like the uh outlet covers they're like you know dollar 53 two dollars something like that in the local hardware store so i go pick them up by this hardware store by myself by my house i'm waiting in line first of all i think it's weird there's only one it's like a long line it's like five people in line one there's only one cashier open but there's three people on the counter just sitting talking each other it's like oh great this is another poorly run business then you see all these signs about you know no refunds and just like nothing positive and they're like taped up and like this mismatch like really just shitty way to to if you're gonna if you need to convey something to your customers like that's a terrible way to do it so then i get up there i think the order is like three dollars and fifty cents pull out uh try to pay by credit card and so lady's like nope you're not spending ten dollars you can't use a card you have to give me cash i was like but i don't have any cash and she's like well that's too bad and i was like okay i was like can you please make an exception i just these are the only two things i need can you please make an exception this one time no okay so i left this thing on the counter walked out the door and ordered on amazon and i'll probably never go back to that store again so like that's the point like the the owner of that store doesn't know that's happened or maybe they do know but they sure as hell can't quantify what their ridiculous policies are losing them in the long term and one of the things i love about reading all these books and studying the history of entrepreneurship is you you really see the contrast mostly and i think it's it's also motivating because there's a lot of people that want to run a business or want to start a business and i get emails from people like this all the time but they may think they it's too hard it's just it's uh maybe they don't have the skills it's just like the bar is so low the vast majority of businesses you will ever encounter are poorly run um i want to read this quote from one of warren buffett's shareholder letters i think is dead on that you know because how many people have analyzed more businesses that are alive today than warren buffett and charlie monger i don't think anybody and it says our major contribution to the operations of our subsidiaries is applause but it's not the indiscriminate applause of a Pollyanna rather it is an informed applause based upon the two long careers we have spent intensively observing business performance and managerial behavior charlie and i have seen so much of the ordinary in business that we can truly appreciate a virtual virtuoso performance what paul was doing he was taking an ordinary or a poor experience from from the customer's perspective and setting the tone like that's not acceptable we're going to do a virtuoso performance it doesn't matter that the customers steal our paper our paper clips and our pens it doesn't matter if they bounce a check every once in a while because the percentage of people that are doing that are tiny compared to the hundred percent of customers that come and realize hey i don't have this is not convenient i don't have a pen i don't have a paper cup hey i get this sign that's you know trying to make fun of people that bounce checks whatever the case is like that is extremely wise and maybe do this already but if not just think about when you go in in in whether it's a restaurant a business anything i'm constantly looking is like could this be done any better like is this an actual good experience and the the businesses that provide excellent experiences i obviously return just like anybody else would and the ones that don't deserve to go out of business for their incompetence because it's easily avoidable incompetence just ask yourself the decision i'm making is it best for the customer yes or no and paul used that like that that is an operating system it's an example of this whenever i saw managers from the head office disrespecting co-workers from the field i defended the field the energy in most other companies runs in exactly the opposite direction and he makes the point that the people serving your customers are a lot more important to the overall health of the company the new sitting in the office and he goes over this over and over again this is not very different remember back i think it was on founders number 37 one of the best books i've ever read for the podcast it's such a crazy story it's called the fish that ate the whale and it's sam zemur he comes to america he's like an 17 or 18 year old russian immigrant starts a business on uh around a on a around rotting bananas or ripe bananas bananas that other banana companies would throw away he realizes hey i got two or three days if i move fast i can sell them and they're still good and they're cheaper for customers but anyways his competition they'd sit i think their headquarters are in boston if i remember correctly and he's like but i'm out here in the field and then when he winds up taking over that giant company right he starts a small company takes over a giant company and he he's constantly asking them when he's their largest shareholder he's like who is like you hired a guy that's running your plantation down in honduras but you're you're overriding his decisions up here in boston who knows more and so he's like that's why he would work out in the fields and that's why he had respect for the people that worked for him because like this guy's out here doing the same stuff we're doing and it just came from a simple idea who actually knows more about what's happening in our business the people in in sam zemur case the people in honduras on his banana plantation and in paul's case the people in the kiko store okay so let's go to some of the ideas he had to come up with to get around his dyslexia he can't he can't do email he still won't do email he has a hard time reading the few times he the funny thing is he's really good at numbers so he'll pour over uh like the income statements that's what he really likes but so they come up with this is funny because they're they use instead of email they're using essentially asynchronous voice recordings and i actually see there's companies trying to do the same thing this is you know close to 40 years ago so they're using voicemail but he says wherever i traveled i found great ideas let's say a co-worker in idaho had devised a particularly brilliant inventory system when i met this co-worker i dialed into our voicemail system and then handed him the phone go ahead i'd say introduce yourself and explain it the co-worker got a chance to explain his his idea in his own voice and by the end of the week thousands of other people would have heard about it too so it's not like a conference call you can pick it up and listen to whenever you want and this is how this is the tool that that paul used to spread information throughout the company when he wasn't in like in the physical store so even though i was generally inaccessible at any given moment it was still possible to reach me and so he continues about the importance of you need to pick up the best ideas we just covered in two of the books i just did on jeff bezos talks about anybody can email jeff at amazon.com jeff and his team would read through these emails they would think about customer anecdotes as valuable intelligence to to fix problems that you don't see in your business so paul's not going to use email he's a suggestion box and then he finds his suggestions and he starts talking to people at different stores like why is this important to you and one of his partners made the good points like you had to remember he's been picking up the best ideas from all around the country and when i read that sentence i'm like hey if you really think about what founders are doing we're picking you and i are picking up the best ideas from the history of entrepreneurship and we're spreading that around and hopefully when you learn these things and you go tell your employees your co-founders your friends and then they keep spreading these ideas and we just create this giant tsunami of some of the best knowledge that you ever find in the history of entrepreneurship and those ideas and those insights can actually make people more effective it's amazing we also relied on the prosaic suggestion box for the for input from our customers so in this case there's a there's a suggestion box it all goes i'm not going to go into detail this weird structure i just told you about but in this case it all goes for some reason with this other company called kinko's northwest but this is very fascinating the marketing manager and the president of kinko's northwest remember you figure they got they could be sitting in the office you know coming up with theories like no we're reading every single message they read every single customer suggestion from their region for nine years that's another idea paul and his team are using this decades ago jeff is still using it the customers that care enough to write you to talk to you to to send you a message like they care enough about your business that they're going to tell you what they feel can be improved like that's very very valuable let's go back to this i love this idea take the service you provide your customers seriously but have fun with everything else they knew they're talking about this this group of capitalist hippies they have like hair down to their butt a bunch of the you know partners were in their early 20s when they started kinko's now they were a few decades into the story they knew how to enjoy life and they knew not to take things too seriously other than delivering their product and i love that i go back to go back to what we just learned from jeff uh the last few weeks you know he's talking about there's a lot of there's a lot of things he says in the meetings and it's really saying you know yeah you could do a shitty job but do you have professional pride a third of your life is going to be dedicated to your work do you actually care about that or not and i love this idea it's like listen we're gonna have fun we're gonna we're gonna have beers after work we're gonna have picnics we're gonna go bowling we're not gonna be too stressed out as much as you can i mean paul has a lot to deal with a lot of stress and he gets on antidepressants later on everything else but the idea is like listen you know life is temporary it's an experience to be enjoyed but our work is serious because we're serving customers and we can never take advantage of that because then they'll go somewhere else there's only one that's what sam walton said there's only one boss and it's the customer he could fire you anytime he wants we were the kind of anti-business we were a kind of anti-business in a way at the beginning we felt we were going to do it our own way we were going to have good values and we're going to make money that's they're talking about the they're it's almost similar to i don't know if it's similar but evan chanard had that kind of that let my people go surfing one of my favorite founders ever come across because he's like listen if i if i'm i never wanted to be a businessman but if i'm going to be and it appears i'm going to be and i'm going to be one for many decades i have to come up i have to do it my way i have to come up with my own philosophy and we're seeing the same kind of ethos here from from paul and his partners and this is an update on the company 13 years in by 1983 we were doing about 70 million in sales a year with 120 stores we were 30 partners with an average age of 28 years old we were motivated by our own value systems ideals and ambitions with scant input from the head office each person made his or her own decisions and then paul's going to talk about there's even difference between the partners this is i'm really running over the point i just made there's no formula your philosophy should match you is the note i left on this page and this is why we all did business differently dave one of his partners admired and sought to emulate big blue chip companies like general electric he ran his company with many more levels of bureaucracy than i would have and yet the policy manual that his company wrote up ended up being adopted by most by most of the other partners so it's a voluntary adoption basis this is how the company was run up until it was sold i hate policy manuals myself obviously i'm never going to spend free time reading them but if our other partners could make use of one i'm glad that dave got it written he loved concocting five-year strategic plans an activity i find pointless and unbearable in contrast he thought my stores were loosely and poorly run i repeatedly told him that he could have expanded his business 10 times faster where he not so wrapped up intending to all the bureaucratic mumbo jumbo so even then he's like okay well i'm gonna have other ideas on the stores that i don't own with you and we don't have to agree on everything and this goes back to why he wants to spread the best information why he wants to get feedback from customers why he wants to talk about what he experiences at other stores like hey you know they had this sign up about the bouncing the checks don't do that and his the point of this section about to read to you is really if you have skin in the game you want to know the dirt inside your company i've observed that corporate executives those who take a salary but don't have a stake in their enterprises like to be lied to it makes them feel comfortable uh they like they they are the type to be deluded into thinking that everything runs as smoothly as the table service as they're at their favorite restaurant they don't want to know about the problems it might upset them the more they are more interested in managing their careers than their companies but if it's your own money on the line you have a completely different attitude you want to find out all the dirt you don't want to be spared the gory details and that's another point he makes in different in different words later on it's like if you there's no such thing as a smooth running business like businesses problems companies are just effective problem solving machines you might solve a problem now there'll be a problem you can't even imagine that you're going to run into a year from now so this idea you're just going to okay i set up my business and it's going to run smoothly that doesn't doesn't exist so knowing that going in and knowing that other people experience that for when you inevitably run into this yourself like okay okay this is normal this is how things are supposed to be this is just another problem i'll solve it and i'll keep moving forward talks about more about not wanting power about constantly trying to uh to to delegate work and you know not being a workaholic even he says you know i can't i won't stop thinking about it but i'm not going to give up all my time i'm still going to have fun i'm still going to spend time with my family and i think this is really smart a lot of people don't believe me when they hear me say that i'm not interested in power but in the deepest sense i'm really not power to me means having to do a lot of work i believe in getting out of as much work as i possibly can when you're not stuck working 12 hours a day you've got time left over to goof around to think creatively and to get to know the people next to you and to get to know the people next to you and eventually you'll be back on your business instead of in it okay so now we got to this chapter that is just remarkable you don't find many chapters like this this is all about his dark side and all about the things that he does not like about himself the imperfections that he has by now you would have to be as bad a reader as i am not to figure out that i have a dark side you rarely hear people talk about their dark sides especially business leaders which is a shame because successful business businesses aren't usually started by laid-back personalities i don't hide the fact that i have a problem with anger i'm not proud of those outbursts i apologize to all my co-workers and partners who've had to deal with the worst of my anger someone once told me the only true victories in life are victories over ourselves and i think that's true my suggestion is fight your emotions don't let them rule you i let my anger rule me too often at kinkos and at home and then he starts talking about all the ways that they have a philosophy they have aphorisms to spread around the company but he's like they're aspirational i don't i failed like no one's perfect i failed to reach up to meet my own expectations he and this is he's going to go into more detail about eventually seeking treatment for this and realizing like i kind of want to live like this everything in each of our businesses were guaranteed with a personal signature i personally was on the hook as were many of my partners for every xerox machine and lease guarantee in the entire business if kinkos took a dive as it nearly did at several junctures in in in its rapid stepladder like growth i stood to lose everything by 1990 when we had about 450 stores i remember discovering my liability was many times greater than my net worth so for many years despite the motivational pep talks i delivered at company meetings i was literally running scared so he's like you can't make money if you're running scared he's telling people not to be running scared and he's doing the exact same thing and he's doing this for a long period time he talks about the outcome here after time these fears wore me down in my lid in my mid to late 40s he's talking about fear of going broke fear of failure failure which i think everybody feels uh in my mid to late 40s i struggled to increasingly to manage my own emotional nature he was i think 52 when he sold the company sometimes i felt i'd created a monster the monster wasn't kinkos it was me after i retired i started taking prozac and believe me it's a much more pleasant experience living in my own skin now this is think about who's going to admit this who's going to write a book and put this on the page we all benefit from this this is a this is remarkable that he bears so much of this he's like listen i from the outside of this huge successful worth hundreds of millions of dollars and it was a not a pleasant experience living in my own skin it's much more pleasant for the people around me too now that he's on prozac you know it talks about you know going to he'd had counselors he'd had to go to um like couples counseling for some with some of his partners i mean there's a lot of times where he's going and trying to seek help for his like just extreme uh behavior and this is just a really really ugly story like how many people would share this voluntarily what i'm about to read you i'm going to let dave tell you an ugly story so dave was one of his partners in the prime of my kinkos life in 1992 i was in the hospital i had been diagnosed with leukemia i i'd already written out out all my read upon my death letters to my kids and gone through massive doses of chemotherapy to wipe out my bone marrow i had no marrow left in my body i was left totally without an immune system and any sort of infection would have killed me i get this phone call from paul and he says what about these pnls what's the problem with them he just gets on me he's the godfather of my daughter he's the lead trustee of my living trust i just knew paul didn't know what to say he's a rhinoceros i don't know what that means i just said paul i'm gonna have to get back to you on that so your partner your friend is on the verge of dying in the hospital and you're calling about profit and loss statements luckily this guy survived and he recovered another partner paul could be abusive he's immature he could be hostile but he could flip that and be phenomenally gracious he would create chaos there was constant turmoil in the organization you never knew what was expected of you paul's extremely difficult to work with because everything else is so personal and this this trait of you know somebody being borderline genius as far as like an operator is concerned and being um you know difficult uh there's a quote you know this is a very this is something we've seen a lot 60 70 years ago david olgabee wrote he's like listen you have to learn to tolerate genius talking about the some of his best employees he's like you have to tolerate genius because it usually and usually we're tolerated because he says genius usually comes with disagreeableness and difficult personalities more examples of him just flipping out this is him losing his temper over bureaucracy i fought overhead every day or student i fought overhead from day one at kinkos it was an uphill battle all the way everywhere i looked i saw unnecessary expenses the problem with bureaucracy at most headquarters is that there's so much there's so much passing the buck no one takes any sort of responsibility uh where and then he's gonna compare in contrast he hated hanging out at headquarters so he's one of the getting fights there and he's going to compare in contrast to behavior he sees the headquarters with what he sees out in the field um so no one takes a sort of responsibility people shoulder as a matter of course out in the field where achievement is transparent and measurable i also began to notice that often the people who survived and received promotions at our head office were the cautious ones and not the creative audacious thinkers the culture was upside down at most companies the headquarters is a notoriously uncreative place spared from reality it is a danger to the health of many companies that said i think i was wrong in my passionate dislike of our head office i just couldn't keep my feelings in perspective i was like a caged animal when i was there and so that leads to him throwing things yelling fighting you know tears there's a lot of turmoil there a lot of emotional turmoil which is exactly what this entire chapter is about which again is so important because this is hidden from outsiders he says the upside to my dark side is passion now this is very interesting another example of uh there's another partner of his that just this the guy hires i think he winds up hiring to be CEO of one of like his these like sub companies and kinkos let's say you know one of these companies that maybe own like 25 of the like you know hundred something stores at time uh but really the the reason i'm bringing this to you is like you have to stand up to bullies that's the only thing they respect so it says mark madden is a passionate guy which i tap which is why i tapped him to run my own company one day i lit into him more severely than usual as mark remembers it one time paul was nagging me about something then he started sending me voicemails he left me about three or four in a row all personal attacks i had had it i hit reply and i said hey paul fuck you and i sent the message then i sat there and thought that probably wasn't a good idea i ran to paul's assistant because i knew she could stop the message but she wasn't in i called the vmx guys these are the people who run kinkos voicemail service couldn't get in touch with them a few a few minutes later the phone rings it's paul he goes hey buddy how you doing then he goes hey hey that message that was great the passion was there hey thanks buddy and he hangs up then he calls back hey don't ever do that again as long as a person this is paul speaking about this he says as long as a person had passion and gumption i could forgive a lot he also talks about great detail where you know the the the financial insecurity or financial anxiety that entrepreneurs go through is a source of a lot of his troubles even like even if he's wildly successful two decades into his career he's worried that you know he could lose everything and so it's just something that he has to deal with and really what he's talking about he's like i just want the independence of wealth that wealth provides and i wanted it desperately as a dyslexic i never lost sight of the fact that savings were going to get me much farther along in life than any report card ever would i wanted to grow up to be like my uncles when they were older they had fancy cars they spent their days polishing them the hardest decision they had to make was where to go to lunch for that day they were also free to take care of their kids to spend time with their families they never missed a dinner at home people often equate wealth with immorality but that's not what i saw as a kid i saw people who made who both made and then saved enough money to have the leisure time to devote to their hobbies and to their families so that's what he wanted i'm going to talk a little bit about because remember i told you this is like a chronological book we're like just we're inside the mind of paul and he's just he's just telling us whatever's on his mind at this point but what's so fascinating is how he felt and how his partners felt after they they sold the company but he works at the company for a little bit after he doesn't own anymore and there's a there's a lot of things that are going on this page let me read it to you and then i'll read my note i'll give you an example of a corporate view of money so remember he always thinks so he's like i ran my business like a peddler and just focus on cash flow that's all i focus on and he says the corporate like they complicate things and they they overthink things and they wind up doing things in a worse way in his opinion than like a simple peddler would we used to sell passport photos at kinko's and we advertised the service in the local yellow pages it would cost us 75 cents to make a passport photo the price the price jumped to a dollar excuse me the cost jumped to a dollar to a dollar 75 when you added the cost of yellow pages so now all in to get the customer in the door and buy the password and make the passport photo and sell the passport photos to them they're at a dollar 75 right uh we'd sell those photos for 13 dollars a piece you think this is a nice business question mark shortly after we sold a controlling stake in kinko's the new budget people came in and got rid of the yellow page ads they saw it as an advertising expense i used to go to the office and think are they deliberately trying to be idiots then like a self-fulfilling prophecy they abandon the passport business that is corporate dyslexia there is a lot of corporate dyslexia going on going on out there rather uh so first note he says he ran he ran his business like a peddler he just focused on cash flow i already told you that the second thing which i found interesting because he's like they saw it as an expense let me quote david olgavey again and you know maybe he's speaking his book a little bit because he made his money as an advertising agency but he says listen you need to treat advertising agency or you need to treat advertising not as an expense it's a production it's a part of manufacturing the product and his point was that some people treat it as like a sales and marketing expense right but he's like if you can't sell your product without advertising what happens is and he's seen this many times people in like a downturn in the economy they'll cut back on advertising we just cut backs on sales like no you you have that in the wrong expense column it's a part of it's a manufacturing cost and if you're going to keep manufacturing your your product then you need to keep advertising and we see a similar idea here from paul is this like yellow page ads work and there's just plenty of books that you can like i think of ray crock uh founder of mcdonald's with you know one of the first books i read for the podcast he talks about once they started advertising in in california um i think that's where some of their first stores were and he says it was like a blindfold was was removed from our like we went from like a trickle to like an overflow it clearly works uh there's an entire section in zero the book by peter teal zero to one talks about you know everybody talks about oh advertising that doesn't work on me and he's like yes it works on you it works on everybody a little bit about the kind of businesses that paul likes they're simple they're high margins and there's no inventory the copy business appealed to me because it fell perfectly within my circle of competence it's a simple business it didn't take extraordinary genius to figure out the fundamentals and it wasn't an inventory business and i think at the time he started copies would cost let's say half of one cent so it's and then they charge 10x that to the customer well this is a good aphorism that he has so uh this is something he learned from his mom no point in bragging in good times and the aphorism is give the glory but take the money during our years of most rapid growth at kinko's i made a policy of not talking to the press what would i have stood to gain by doing so i kept my personal profile intentionally low when it came to my relations with the outside world when forbes published its first piece of me back in the mid 90s i wouldn't let them take a picture of me i always told my partners to give the glory and take the money there's no point in bragging in good times as my mother used to say your friends don't need to hear it and your enemies won't believe it anyway and as many other entrepreneurs know it invites competition unwanted competition okay so they wind up selling the business to this uh venture capital firm that reorganizes it and then resells at the fedex a couple years later and this is the surprising this is in a chapter called no when to walk away and it says no matter what anyone says walking away from something you spent 30 years nurturing remember he's this is going to make him hundreds of millions of dollars and this is how he feels after the fact this is very surprising um no matter what or maybe counterintuitive is a better way to describe it no matter what anyone says walking away from something you spent 30 years nurturing whether it's a child a company or even a hobby is going to take a toll how could it not how is it humanly possible to say goodbye to something that contains so much of you and your love and devotion when my father shuttered his business in 1981 a part of him died along with it it wasn't that he stopped living after but it was hard on him i don't know if closing the company took the life out of him but he died soon five years after and so one of his main partners dan there's a quote here where it talks about how he felt after the sale and he says when the kinkos thing ended for me i almost felt like i wasn't anywhere any i wasn't anywhere anymore when the job was gone i was gone dan went into a severe depression most of us men identify far too personally with our work it's only human and the note i left myself is there should be a podcast here's the podcast idea if you want to start one you know we're always interviewing people that are raising money now or running businesses now obviously we focus on learning from dead entrepreneurs as much as we can are people that are at least close to dead or at least retired i guess a better way to put that there should be a podcast that only interviews founders five or ten years after they sold and see if they regret it i would definitely subscribe to that and this is a little bit more about what happened after the sale he wasn't ready for this the first decision of cd and r that's the firm made after the sale was to name himself this is the guy that did the deal interim interim ceo this was not what we were expecting cd and r swiftly began to set about creating a new company on its own turn on its own terms very quickly relations between the old and the new guard disintegrated it was startling how quickly they stopped listening to us increasingly i was cut out of decisions i should have left right then yet in truth i wasn't yet ready to let go and then he talks about he's writing this book about five years six years after this happened the book is close to 15 years old i think it was published in 2006 and what's interesting is like he's still emotionally troubled by this he says for emotional reasons i just can't go inside the stores anymore i don't know if i ever will again it's too difficult for me when i see kinko's co-workers today they naturally want to tell me about their problems i can't blame them i spent three this is very this is a very interesting statement he's gonna make i can't blame him i spent three decades browbeating them to confess every grievance about their work lives to me but i don't want to hear their complaints anymore and he continues his thought continues this thought about the ideas like i'm a hypocrite i'm a hypocrite we all are he says the truth is for everything i just told you about keeping paul separate from kinko's it's been excruciatingly difficult for me to let go my friend john used to tell me that sometimes in life you have to forget who you were and learn to be happy with who you are i'm trying to do that now and then this was i mean honestly i laughed the first time i read the sentence because it was completely out of the left field he's talking about the health issues that the company caused them 10 years ago i had bad gas i couldn't sleep at night and my neck hurt constantly i've read almost 200 biographies for this podcast no one's complaining about the bad gas they had now i don't have gas my neck doesn't hurt and i sleep like a baby getting to this point hasn't been easy but it was necessary we finally took our chips off the table and let the game move on without us and one way he's coming to accept who he was is he finds a new mission he calls it repurposing yourself he's like okay i don't run kinko's anymore so now he runs at least the time in the book he starts doing he starts an asset management company he runs he invests his own money and then invests money on behalf of other people he develops he has a lot of money real estate stuff like that but so he has a business he can run that's not that doesn't require as much stress as it was when he was running kinko's but still gives him a purpose in life you know he's got to find something to do for the next few decades he's got a great definition of success i want to read this to you now i always believe that the definition of success in life is when your kids want to spend time with you after they've grown up and so that's something you know he tried to be aware of even when he was building kinko's he's home on the weekends he's home at night for dinner he's still thinking about the business but he's not going to just he's not going to be an absent father an absent husband and then i'll close on this there's just still obviously a little bit of ambiguity as for myself i'm still letting my soul catch up with my body how long will it take i can't answer that question but it's a good one to ask do you know why children finally outgrow their tendency to ask millions of questions not because they've got the answers they figure out that it irritates the grown-ups if you've stopped asking questions start asking them again learn to be immature at least some of the time it's taken me my whole life to figure out that i don't have all the answers all i've ever had was a bunch of questions when you think about it kinko started with a question how come there's a copy center here at usc and not one up at ucsb why is that the most important thing is to keep dreaming keep playing and keep asking questions and that is where i'll leave it for the full story i recommend you buy the book if you buy the book using the link that's in the show notes you'll be supporting the podcast at the same time if you have a friend or a co-worker that you feel would benefit from learning these lessons as well and you want to give them a gift subscription i'll leave a link in the show notes to do that as well that is 181 books down 1000 to go and i'll talk to you again soon
